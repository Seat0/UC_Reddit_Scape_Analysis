I am applying to UCLA, UCB and UCSB but Im worried that since Im from a private school itll significantly lower my chances of getting in. (one of my friends told me this.) I also know that something like 90% of junior level transfer admits to these schools are California Community College students, which makes me a little more nervous.  I'm a sophomore now and my first year I had a GPA of 3.9. To anyone who has been in a situation like this or just has insight I'd love to know how you think I'd fare."

I'm trying to get more hands-on exposure to different sides of computer science, like software development, cybersecurity, and data science, to find a field I'm passionate about. I know the Stats/DS department is great about sharing opportunities, but since I'm not a CS major (though I am in the process of potentially switching), I'm not familiar with the CS department's resources. I was wondering how the CS department typically communicates about research, student projects, jobs and what not. On a broader note for upperclassmen and alumni: What did you do in your first or second year that helped you get familiar with different CS fields, even if it wasn't a formal opportunity like research or an internship? My main priority is just to learn and explore, so I'm open to any and all suggestions, whether it's personal projects, specific workshops, or anything else you found valuable."

        "body": "Hi everyone! For context I am a second year PBS major (on paper) but I have been doing biology coursework for the past year in hopes of switching into the major. However, the first year for both PBS and Bio are effectively the same in coursework so this fall has been my first real year doing biology coursework. \nIn short, I am taking MCDB1A, CHEM 109A, PHYS 6A+6AL, and CHEM2BL. I have already failed the first physics midterm and will likely be retroactively withdrawing the class and I didn’t do particularly well on my other exams.\nThis has led me towards wanting to save physics for next year and fill my schedule w PSYCH 10A/B for the winter and spring and declare biopsych+ pre-health so I wouldn’t have to fully switch departments, and the upper division courses seem more interesting as well. \n\nI’m torn about this decision though because I really want to go into healthcare, primarily dental, but I feel like my academics aren’t very strong, and I don’t even have a job or many clubs taking away from my study time. \n\nBasically I’m asking this:\n- Is pre-med/dental worth pursuing if i’m struggling as much as I am now in lower division courses?\n- Should I cut my losses and stick with my on paper PBS major?\n\nI also have a 3.5 overall GPA with a 3.2 in major courses (gen chem didn’t go very well). \n\nThanks everyone!"

I don't mind if its just one person or a small group as well as if you're super fluent or know a few signs! Just hoping to meet new people and practice ASL :)"

This feels really more than what’s specified or required in their website, and everyone else I’ve spoken with seems to have not had to submit things even like their voter ID.\n\nWas just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience because the whole back and forth has been a nightmare with the residency office.

You probably have a good idea of what courses to enroll in for Winter Quarter. But remember that every major at UCSB involves a complicated web of courses, some required and some optional, and even the best-prepared student can sometimes get tangled up in that web. \n\nThe best way to avoid errors and ensure that you're taking the correct classes to progress toward your degree is to **meet with an academic advisor before your pass time.** If you're already in a major, that'll be an advisor in your major department; if you're undeclared, that will be one of the advisors in the College of Letters and Science (https://www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising).\n\nSad to say, I've seen too many students who did not take this advice — and who suffered unpleasant consequences as a result. A recent unhappy example was a student who needed to take a sequence of required courses for their major. Most students in that major start this sequence in Winter Quarter of their first year, but this student decided on their own — and without consulting with an academic advisor — that they would wait until Fall Quarter of their second year to start. Imagine their reaction when it came time to register for Fall Quarter classes, and they discovered that the first course in this required sequence is only offered in Winter or Spring! This student is now going to either (a) be a year behind or (b) have to take these courses at a community college. Either one of these options means extra time and extra expense for this student to graduate. **Don't let this happen to you!**\n\nSo please make a point of meeting with an academic advisor before your first pass time. It will just take a few minutes for them to confirm that your proposed list of Winter Quarter courses is correct — or to suggest changes in that list to help ensure that you're on the right academic track.\n\nGo Gauchos!"

Set an alarm/Google reminder of when your 1st pass time starts. Don't say to yourself, \"Meh, I'll get on that the next morning...\" That's a recipe for frustration. Register for classes ***as soon as*** your pass time opens.\n\nThis may seem elementary to a lot of folks on this sub, but trust me: there are dozens of students every January/week 1 who are scrambling for classes bc they \"forgot about pass times.\" Oof.\n\nAlso: If there's a winter class you'd anticipated taking that you don't see in \"Find Courses,\" I'd encourage you to contact your department advisors for additional information/clarification. E.g. a student just asked me about MCDB 110 not being available in winter quarter. I reached out to the department and learned, \"Though MCDB 110 Biochemistry won't be offered this coming W26, the plan is to instead offer one very large offering in S26, which will have the equal amount of the usual annual combined seating.  Our 25/26 offerings are listed on our website under [Proposed MCDB courses for 2025-2026](https://undergrad.biology.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025-2026%20Courses%208-28.pdf).\"\n\nEDIT: screenshot won't load; just go to the yellow nav bar at the top and select \"Registration\" then select \"registration\" from the blue field. Dates will populate along the right hand side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqh89bvsqcwf1.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f2471ff7834ea3c55cfd6b446bda161c5ffd9a4\n\n"

        "body": "Dear UCSB Community,\n\nWe are the A.S. Bike Committee, the student-led and funded committee that pays for the construction and maintenance of our campus bicycle infrastructure. We would like to provide an update on the progress of the planned ILP Bike Path, and clarify Bike Committee’s role in the new bicycle safety and enforcement program. \n\nLast spring, after several years of advocacy from the Bike Committee, campus administration conceptually approved a replacement bike path between the Library and ILP. The Bike Committee immediately initiated the planning and design process for a layout that includes both a new path and two roundabouts connecting it to the existing bike network. A preliminary sketch is below. We are now within weeks of receiving the finalized blueprints and cost estimate for the project. At that point, the last step before construction will be raising enough funds to complete construction. Although we anticipate funding to be a challenge, Bike Committee, A.S., and the Office of Budget and Planning will work together to make it happen as soon as possible. We are extremely confident that this bike path will be built. \n\nWe also want to address the widespread concern regarding the ticketing of bikers on walkways as part of the school’s new “Bike Safety and Enforcement” program. We would like to emphasize that Bike Committee did not make the decision to begin police enforcement, and we recognize that increased police presence on campus is never an ideal solution. Our contribution to the program was to develop the educational module offered to cited bikers. Completing the module allows you to completely waive the $40 ticket fine. Bike Committee saw this as the best way to redirect the effort from enforcement to education.\n\nHopefully this information eases some of your concerns. We appreciate your patience as Bike Committee works towards a permanent solution that supports UCSB’s beloved bike culture.  \n\n[Preliminary design plan by campus architect Ernest Knapp](https://preview.redd.it/xkdw7ffhhivf1.png?width=8550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1949e62e97425970b11012741cbd390cf9c1a2a0)\n\nIf you have any questions or input, please contact Bike Committee at [bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu](mailto:bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu)\n\nFor further context regarding the ILP Bike Path, see our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1i0wesd/ilp_bike_path_update_from_as_bike_committee/) from January.\n\nWishing you all the best,\n\nThe A.S.

I've always been drawn into physics by how fundamental it is to everything surrounding us; I think that I can be applied to almost every other science out there, which is why it is such an important foundation in our lives and society.\n\nWhile I've always been drawn to it, I've never been confident in which specific direction of physics I want to pursue. By that, I mean that I'm unsure which area of physics I should moving into my masters' years (which I intend to do, but I'm also unsure how to navigate yet), as well as what career or job I should have in mind while I pursue my studies. I'll help y'all out a little bit regarding who I am and what I want in my career: I want a stable, well-paying job (obviously) that I am satisfied with and will complement the BS in physics that I plan to graduate with from college. One important thing that I think that I should mention is that I frankly really dislike working with and around other people, especially for long periods of time; I'm really sensitive to noise and it severely distracts me from focusing, I've never contributed much to groups because I suffer from social anxiety, and overall I suppose that I perform far better by myself academically. I also have poor muscle coordination and I don't really work well hands-on. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm kind of autistic (lol), but I really want to find a career to pursue where those characteristics don't mitigate whatever position or role which I will be in. Also, I know that it probably sounds extremely cliche and like a pipe dream, but I really want to just change the world somehow; just do something where I will be remembered and leave a legacy behind in my name. Again, I'm not sure how or what yet, but I know that's what I want. And that of course leads me to ask which field of physics I should pursue, the steps in order to attain certifiable experience in that field, and how it will complement whichever job might be best suited for me. The steps before entering the job market especially, I am honestly pretty unfamiliar with and don't really know how to use to propel myself towards my career. I commute an hour to my school, so college resources aren't as readily available as I hope they would be. If there's anything specific at UC Santa Barbara that I should look into, please let me know! And this doesn't even cover how and where I should receive my masters from, as well as how to network with people (which is a whole different issue for me).\n\nBasically, I want to know which steps that I should take in pursuit of the career that I want, and even what career would fit me best based on my personality. I just kind of want a roadmap and goals that I can set for myself and follow. I know that there are so many possibilities for my career, especially only as an undergraduate college student, but I really want to have an idea of which direction I should take my future to."

I'm just confused where all these tickets are and how would I do the trip back to **Goleta Train Station.** For example, I would buy a ticket on Amtrak from **Goleta** to **Ventura**, than stay on the **Pacific Surliner** until I get to **Chatsworth Train Station**? And how would I get from the area around **Chatsworth** back to **Ventura Train Station** without driving a car, can I just hop on the same **Pacific Surliner** back towards **Goleta** from **Chatsworth Train Station** even though my tickets states that on my return **Ventura Train Station** is where the train will be leaving for **Goleta**, and it's free until they check my ticket at the **Ventura Train Station??** sorry if this is confusing im trying to be as clear as possible. I also know there's a V720 discount I can add, but the main issue is I just don't know how it works getting back and forth. Thanks for any help"

It is much easier and faster to access your dorm. The rent is 1390$ per month and I will cover the security deposit. The room is a double bed-room and it has a bathroom only for you and your roommate. The room is on the first floor where it is closest to the entrance and exits. The lease is for the whole 2025-2026 school year and this is open for UCSB, SBCC, and transfer students. There is a bus stop next to it if you need to ride to school or anywhere.

Also, it feels like there haven’t really been any transfer-specific mixers or events where you can actually meet people, which makes it even harder to connect.\n\nI’d really love to meet some new people who are also down to hang out, explore Isla Vista/SB, go to events or parties together, grab food, or just chill at the beach.

        "body": "Hi y'all,\n\nWinter 2026 registration is approaching. I built a Chrome extension called \"RateMyGaucho\" that brings professor reviews directly into GOLD while you're browsing classes, so you don't have to constantly switch tabs.\n\nThe extension is super lightweight and adds:\n\n* UCSB Plat professor ratings displayed right under professor names in GOLD\n* Hover tooltips showing overall rating, difficulty, would take again %, and number of reviews\n* Direct links to full professor profiles if you want to read more\n* Works seamlessly with GOLD's interface without any lag\n\n(Also, RateMyGaucho is now featured on the UCSB Plat home page banner! 🎉)\n\nHere are some screenshots:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib7pkm45ncuf1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f884d4c1a5cf69117822fc5d8212b9df73ff07\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6jjs2y5ncuf1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac1e7591c3313222b85d682a41f6081b628ad20b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2q4nz17ncuf1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcfbd2a1008f8cea58b89aabedf394d6110d0f96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqeydyu7ncuf1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaead275f48508361350d1943b2374f96d693371\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmzp9em8ncuf1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a272de14f03f2e71d0bf5a9274bff24d3a3fc8\n\n**How to use:**\n\n1. Download RateMyGaucho from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ratemygaucho/pgdlhncoocgekdmdiikdlgkndihcobhh?authuser=0&amp;hl=en)\n2. Make sure the extension is active\n3. Go to GOLD and browse classes like normal\n4. You'll now see ratings under each professor's name automatically\n\nI hope RateMyGaucho helps you make better decisions during registration and saves you time from tab switching. It's a new project, so there might be some bugs, and I'd appreciate any feedback you have.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing or have ideas for new features, the project is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsloganmann/RateMyGaucho).\n\nYou can DM me on Reddit with any questions or suggestions.\n\nGo Gauchos!"

I'm primarily want to do this because I don't really have much of an interest in CE as I don't see myself working on chips and other hardware related stuff. This has been because my interests have changed towards working on medtech/biotech related work using CS/AI. Additionally, the flexibility CS has over CE is very important for me as I can invest my time into research, clubs, projects, etc. vs me doing work that I don't want to even do.\n\nMy problem is that I have a very low GPA due to a health condition I faced during mid winter quarter all the way until mid spring quarter (\\~ 10 weeks) and unfortunately I wasn't compensated for my sickness in terms of exam deadlines (yes for homework here and there but didn't make too much of an impact). Due to my low GPA I don't meet one of the minimum requirements. I'm just in a dilemma right now as it feels like I'm paying money towards classes I don't even want to do that are major requirements while having the possibility of screwing up my GPA even more bcs these are some hard engineering classes.\n\nDoes anyone have guidance or potentially been in the same boat to offer help for this. Sorry for the rant but thank you for the help!"

Although I have taken a lot of relevant courses, I'm honestly worried that I forgot a lot of the stuff that I've learned over the years.

Right now i’m looking at just eating up the $8100 and thanking god that my parents aren’t murdering me for wasting $8100. Housing says the only way for me to be relieved of paying rent is to find someone to take over the bed space. \n\n\n    \n   If anyone is willing to take over the bed space, I will pay half of the rent for the entire duration of the contract. This means instead of the remainder rent for the year ($7,425) you will only pay $3,712.50 dollars for the year.\n\n   You will assume control of the contract and i will write you a check (or cash) for half of what is owed on the duration of your stay.

        "body": "(This was made awhile ago so probably outdated… no longer in IV :,)\n\nAs a pretense, I’m not much of a coffee drinker. Evaluated based off taste, overall vibes, and study spot potential. Dune, Handlebar Coffee, The Arbor, &amp; Coral Tree Cafe I didn’t get to. \n\n1. Old Town Coffee Goleta\nIced lavender matcha latte: 8.5/10. I usually don’t love matcha, but this one I would order again. Docked off points for the rather tiny cup. All 5 ounces of it was yummy though. \nAmbiance: I originally rated the ambiance lower for the lack of lighting and AC, BUT I had failed to check out the entire cafe! This place deserves its 10/10 for vibes. There is not only abundant seating and charging outlets, there is a bar, ARCADE, pool, ping pong table, AND beautiful, sunny outdoor seating decorated with a fun hippie-like mural and string lights. Not to mention this place is open later than most other cafes I could find in Goleta/SB. I will be back… again, and again, and again!!! Playlist started out very western/country and later became more rnb/indie pop. Definitely some Still Woozy fans present. \n\n2. Kozy\nCaramel latte blended: 9/10. I was pleasantly surprised\nAmbiance: A cult favorite est. 2023. The pothos plants that brim the perimeter of this cozy cafe are beautifulllll. This place is fully equipped with AC, clean restroom, and fire playlist. You’ll find other students writing papers and chatting up Hinge dates. 9/10 for the easily lovable aesthetic. \n\n3. Kin Bakeshop\nStrawberry milk: 9.5/10 This drink is delicious, light, fluffy and refreshing. Serving was small but I drank every last drop. \nAmbiance: This place is wonderful. Here you will find kind, hospitable workers, delectable sweet treats, exciting coffee, and aesthetic picturesque Pinterest vibes. It’s not really a place to sit, do work, or go to hang out for long, but it is a great place to stop by with a friend or date and enjoy a morning treat! There is usually a long line in the mornings, so be prepared to wait half an hour to a couple hours. Feel free to come later in the day if you don’t mind missing out on some of the most popular dessert items. Employees and customers alike were so sweet. 8/10 for this category only because I wish it was a place one could spend more time! \n\n4. Java Club \nGhiradelli Mocha Blended: too sweet but what do you expect with a Ghiradelli mocha blended? If you want something less sweet order something else. It was yummy though I have an inkling the rest of the menu is delish. 6.8/10\nAmbiance: 10/10 This place is beautiful, and I mean BEAUTIFUL. It is a CAFE!!!! I thought places like this went extinct, and if you think similarly, worry not, Java Club has got you. The vibe is earthy worldwide, but also fashionista American mom in 2002. If you know, you know. It looks like what Java Club sounds like, simply amazing. It can get warm in here, but there are ceiling fans and you can take off your freaking coat. Indoor and outdoor seating, some outlets and yes, wifi. They play Cigarettes After Sex. Ugh to listen to Apocalypse while doing work at an earthy cafe drinking a Ghiradelli mocha blended. This is life!!!! Also, I recommend checking out their comedy nights they are quite the vibe. \n\n5. Caje\nIced strawberry matcha: Very yummy, would recommend. Fruity and fresh. Only a dollar more for 8 ounces more so why not go for the large? Nice presentation too. 9/10\nAmbiance: on a hot day I wouldn’t recommend sitting inside, feels stuffy but other than that lots of seating outdoors and it’s a great space to study or meet with a friend. Extra points for being in IV and open til 8pm. Minus a point for no restroom, like, is that even legal? 7.5/10\n\n6. Dean\nVietnamese Iced Coffee: 8/10, it was soooo big and very yummy. It was actually so big I didn’t finish it. I was very energized, it did the trick.\nAmbiance: 8/10 This place is the best work-type environment by far. It’s clean, minimalistic, has great lighting, and just feels easier to focus on because of its intentional choice of decor. Focus-inducing environment, only docked off points because your purchase buys 2 hrs of wifi\n\n7. Dart\nIced Churro Latte with Almond Milk: 6.5/10, I don’t really taste the churro aspect of this churro latte… The drink itself is fine, but not a must have. It’s not too sweet and not too bitter. It has a slight cinnamon sugar flavor. It’s a light coffee drink. \nAmbiance: 8.5/10 This place is so colorfully &amp; beautifully decorated. Its ceiling is adorned with what must be a hundred lanterns and the shop is the perfect combination of cozy, bright, clean, and fun. The reason for the docked off points here is because this is not a spot meant for working, but perhaps that’s part of its charm. There are zero outlets available for customer use and this makes it challenging to spend more than two hours here with a laptop. If you want a spot to enjoy company with a friend, grab some caffeine or a bite to eat, or just enjoy a moment in a place that feels just so Santa Barbara, this spot is for you."

I'll be honest, as embarrassing as it sounds, this year my main goal is to make enough friends and maybe even meet my first girlfriend. Normally, I'd be hopeful, but frankly I'm really losing it because I'm commuting nearly an hour away from campus each day. I have no idea how I'm going to make connections if I'm not even near anyone at a campus where most people already live on or near, and with no pre-established connections already. This is still notwithstanding how bad my social skills and anxiety are; I failed to make any meaningful connections last year even when residing in the dorms. My circumstances this year just spell disaster for me socially and I have no idea what to do. I don't know how I can survive this year without feeling miserable by the end because no one wants to hang out with me. I'd say I'm used to this feeling but recently it's been eating away at me. I don't even know what I'm asking for really, all I want is hope that my time to find people who will want to hang out with me will come, because it seems that life would rather want me to do anything but make meaningful connections."

I kept the reader from that class because the stories were so great and I absolutely loved that class. I lent that reader to a friend some time ago and of course they lost it. I was telling my kids about some of the stories and they were bummed I didn’t have that reader anymore.\n\nI have reached out via email, instagram, and I’ve called and left messages in the voicemail for the English Department, but no response.  All I want to know, is whether or not it’s at all possible to get a copy of that reader. A simple yes or no is all I’m looking for, I know it’s a long shot, but not getting any response is a little frustrating. I was hoping they had some kind of archive, I’d pay for it if it was possible, I really just want to read some of those stories again.\n\nAnyone on this sub an English major or work in the department?"

If you click the link, which btw I don't think I've ever seen an official UCSB link that looked like the one in the email, it sends you to a google sites page that tells you to click another link to be redirected to the SSO page.

I have been here for a long time and have not heard of \"myUCSB.\"\n\nThe credentials \"ucsb.edu\" look accurate; however, I searched for an Aidan Kraus on the Internet related to UCSB, and they did not pop up. To test the link, I simply googled ucsb.edu/uc4301 and that takes me to page not found. I did not click the link. Did anyone else get this or does a faculty member actually know who Aidan is and if the link is legitimate? This seems very scammy and fishy and I'd rather take the risk of alerting others and getting verification that this email is legit than not knowing and not clicking the link cuz this looks super fishy.\n\n"

After using it for a bit, I realized that the bike simply wasn't for me because of the look (something I definitely should've considered before buying, but I was desperate). It's dark blue and a bit rusty on the handlebars, but overall in good shape. As with all used bikes, it does require some maintenance. I bought it for $150, but I'm selling it for $120, and I'm also willing to further negotiate the price. I can also provide photos of the bike if necessary.\n\nEdit: Here are some photos of the bike\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6oem849t5sf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf0829b73cdd40413796c482aa6f9c43b4e42a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuhd4849t5sf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08fe76a9965644f18b7a086c885b31fb2420e5c9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oazbv849t5sf1.jpg?width=1980&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=088d84e8df7358c089eaa96a5bb567b6471f6f70"

I just wanted to know if this was true or not and how I could find parties and functions in the upcoming year when I do get to UCSB and if any other future transfers also like to party and go to raves!

        "body": "My partner and I recently moved out of our IV apartment and were not given back our full security deposit despite keeping the place basically spotless. While some of our landlord’s claims for withholding money are valid, others are unjust. For example, it seems as if they charged us for repainting the entire apartment despite there being almost no damage to any paint (the only damage was one cabinet shelf). Compared to the rest of our complex, we moved out fairly late and it seemed as though they were repainting the entirety of every apartment, which makes us reason that this is normal procedure for every apartment after tenants move out, and we’re pretty sure they can’t charge us for if it’s routine. When we asked for evidence of damage and for itemized receipts, they provided photos that did not match the amount of work that they charged us for, and did not give any detailed receipts at all. We were only given an invoice for painting from the painter, and we were charged extra for having to paint the ceiling, however our landlord did not provide photo evidence of any damage to the ceiling, which would violate AB 2801 and civ. code §1950.5 if we’re not mistaken. Additionally, they charged us for cleaning that they themselves described as being normal wear and tear. After talking to the IV tenants union, we are considering small claims court and we would like to know if anyone has experience doing that, and how that went. \n\nTLDR: looking to take landlord to small claims for unjustified charges, any stories or experiences being in the same situation is appreciated"

If anyone has been in Anacapa Hall before can you say if the fire alarm gets pulled off a lot in this hall or it’s just people making popcorn/bacon this one time and the alarm keeps going off?"

Now third year the aid is bullshit. Each year they got me with some new shit as if they don’t want me to get this damn degree. Either way what was the whole point of an appeal if they’re still going to give me the left overs. I literally tell them I’m highkey homeless and they think it’s cute to give me so little. Not to mention i didn’t get a middle class scholarship as if I’ve got any damn money to my name. Let’s not even get started on the fact that they keep trying to get me to take out loans as if they’re going to pay for my shit. In this economy for an immigrant student that’s kind of the most stupid choice you can make. I’m not even going to have a job post graduation and they want me to get deep shit into student debt.

        "body": "Earlier today I almost got knocked off by bike while passing someone who was swerving in the lane, so here are a few reminders about common courtesy (especially for freshmen, but man do I know some people here who need to hear these).\n\n1. Don't swerve and keep right. If you're passing someone, pass on the left and return to the right side of the lane as soon as you can. On a realted note, keep single file, it's near impossible to pass people riding tandem, especially during peak traffic. \n2. Call out when you're passing. It makes it easier to pass if they know you're there.\n3. As a result of the last point, KEEP YOUR DAMN HEADPHONES OUT OF YOUR EARS. You need to be able to hear the world around you, you could seriously hurt someone. Hearing callouts is important.\n4. Yeild to traffic already in the roundabouts. Last year I got ran off the road by someone who didn't yield, not a particularly pleasant experience.\n5. Lastly, just pay attention. Knowing the above also means that you know when it's safe to break these principles, but you still need to know your surroundings.\n\nAs someone who tends to ride faster than traffic, PLEASE listen to help keep us all safe. I'm done ranting but as a closing note damn y'all really need to learn to ride a bike with other people nearby.\n\n  \nPS- Scooters please keep out of the damn bike racks: you're not even supposed to be allowed on campus. You're also not an exception to the above points, and honestly I could write a whole other post about all y'all."

I just don’t know if there would be many people or clubs even that would share the same kind of interests or hobbies I like. Also I’m not really sure I feel ready to take the steps to becoming independent since I’ve been heavily reliant on my family my whole life and I don’t think I’m ready for this big of a change just yet.

Sometimes there were really interesting bits of information that I'd like to go back and see just for my own curiosity's sake, and sometimes there is information that would be legitimately helpful to be able to review for classes that I'm taking now. Either way, the whole point of attending a university that we're collecting knowledge and it would be nice to have that knowledge a bit more permanently. And yes, I know I could be taking more thorough notes or something, but even that would not be the same thing as having access to all of the slides and readings from all my classes.

(Recreation &amp; Exercise Classes). You'll also enjoy live performances, games, giveaways, and prizes from RecFest's sponsors.\n\nFor a full list of events and performances at RecFest, check out [https://recreation.ucsb.edu/rec-fest-schedule](https://recreation.ucsb.edu/rec-fest-schedule)\n\nFor a video preview of RecFest, go to [https://youtu.be/pXgv-lN2KDU](https://youtu.be/pXgv-lN2KDU)\n\n(Not-so-subtle plug: Stop by the UCSB Rowing tent and learn about the team - and try your hand at a sprint on one of the rowing machines.)"

At first I thought that maybe it was because I didn't go to orientation or because I'm a promise scholar that I got my classes automatically, but I talked to others and I'm the only person who experienced this???? Low key im so greatful, especially since I got chem 1A which I know some people are still wait listed for, but I'm just kinda confused.

I was going to take this course because I wanted to take a C LIT course at UCSB, but the professor just sent out a message with everything we need for the course. Maybe it's because I've never taken a literature course here but I was kind of shocked. He's asking us to buy 5 different books that come out to around $70. Of course I can pirate it but he doesn't allow any electronics and stated that students must have the physical copy? i dont get why we cant just download the book and use it off our computer or ipads which most people have, and if not they can loan one from the school. Is this normal?? I've had to buy other school resources for chem, physics, and history classes which are inevitable but forcing us to buy the books when their are other means of getting them are kinda insane to me. I just don't get why we spend so much money for this school and then they drain us even more by having us buy extra resources for classes. So is this the norm for C LIT majors?? How do you have money for these courses!! These are my thoughts, I would love to hear from anyone who has taken a course like this. "
