The gym itself has nice views but it's fuckinf ugly and has this stinky pool inside. Plus a lot of old men and high schoolers who don't even go to Ucla go here. \n\nLA Fitness Westwood: this gym is dirty and lowkey has unhoused people in the showers all the time, most who mind their own but some who do weird things. Often times you'll see gym bros trying to act tough and pick fights over nothing. The MILFs are hot here but they all don't want to be here so it's not a place to even make any eye contact. It has a lot of young professionals going. The entrance is a bitch, you gotta show the world you are entering and leaving in heavy traffic. \n\nWooden Gym: where I go proudly dick-in-hand. Sometimes I hear the guys singing in the shower, including yours truly. The sauna is dirty AF and we can't share it with the ladies because they think it causes sex to happen. If anything, I need a private sauna just for me so prevent temptation from others reaching me. The equipment is dirty. Like fucking..two people at the front desk and a huge gym. Frat boys hog the equipment. Some juice heads on roids go often. Mornings are the best time to go to avoid crowds ans staff members who like to use their lunch time there. Not a great gym but it's here. \n\n\nKinross rec center: I got admitted by flirting with a former TA who helped me sneak in. It's just a glorified bungalow! It's clean and without frat boys. It's alright but I've had better. "

I am no fucking amateur to hard classes and exams too, for context I am a premed who finished all premed requirements and have a 3.9 GPA. I have done those shitty lavelle 14B exams and those putrid 14D exams but not once did I take an exam and think to myself \"holy shit I genuinely think if I never studied I would have actually done better.\" I am off 700 mg of caffeine, a 6 mg zyn, and was zoned in for at least 20 hours total in the past 2 days studying for this exam. I pulled an all nighter last night and locked in the day before and went to every discussion. I was fucking zoned. I guess it is my fault that you literally had to be genuinely STUPID to do well on that exam. The questions ranged from something so specific that he probably mentioned for 2 seconds to something so general and dumbed down but all the answer choices were so similar to the point where a dyslexic person would blow up just reading the choices. The practice exam on canvas was so easy but covered all content and wasn't worded like shit so everyone went in the exam hoping for the best. God was that the greatest edge he could have done. Instead, it is like he went into Chat GPT and told him \"generate me some questions\" and then when GPT gave him half decent questions and decent answer choices he then said \"make it so that only the illiterate can somehow piece together wtf I am asking.\" You can not make this shit up, everyone I asked from the dumb as bricks to smart asf all said the same thing: \"wtf was that shit\". This exam in no way, shape, or form reflected someones actual knowledge of the course. If they do not curve that shit WE, yes WE are genuinely fucked."

Behaviors and reactions to these new technologies may have been tested on you without your consent.\n\nI cannot fully comprehend and put into words of what happened to me. Ever since my senior year of 2023, I suspected that I have been a target of [electronic torture](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/InterimCommittee/ReL/Document/27234). It became difficult for me to tell reality from the preconceived experiences I thought. My perspective began to change as I became paranoid, thinking that even friends or family are involved. I cannot claim any organization that may have been doing this because I have no concrete evidence. Based on how pervasive and widespread it is, I can assume that it operates as a unit, each with roles in altering my reality. \n\nI do not know the purpose, but I began to hypothesize that it may have been a government conducted experiment to test [direct energy weapons](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-believe-us-embassy-staff-and-cia-officers-were-hit-with-high-power-microwaves-heres-how-the-weapons-work/#:~:text=Havana%20syndrome%20is%20likely%20linked,the%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense). Then, I began researching about previous experiments done and concealed by CIA due to being unethical (MKUltra). Although I have no evidence of this, I am highly suspicious. \n\nNot intending to fear-monger, government agencies may have been conducting [experiment](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/dnsa-intelligence/2024-12-23/cia-behavior-control-experiments-focus-new-scholarly#:~:text=Under%20code%20names%20that%20included,part%20of%20a%20CIA%20test) by being a participant without you knowing this.\n\nUntil now, it feels like I am being controlled. From physiological functions to emotions with no end. It feels alienating because no one has the same experiences like this that I can talk with. I just want to know what everyone knows regarding this that can be helpful in my case other than seeking a psychiatrist help. \n\n"

At the Amazon pickup lockers, a 20-30 year old black man wearing a ski mask started yelling at me for turning around and making eye contact with him after I spoke with an employee. I ignored him and he proceeded to yell death threats at me for like 5 minutes, during which one lady speed walked out the store and the other two bystanders just stood and watched.\n\nYes, I am aware that UCLA offers an evening escort service but it would ridiculous to call one every single time I need to step out of my apartment or off campus.

I dealt with a lot of social anxiety and stuck with friends who treated me as more of an afterthought. I also made the choice to stay in those taxing relationships and not branch out. It was not like me to advocate for myself or make an effort to feel seen. I went through undergrad passively; I didn’t speak up in class, go to office hours unless I had to, and got my letters of recommendation from my boss and coworkers. I didn’t have close friends, and I really struggled to be vulnerable with them, especially with me being so dismissive of my internal struggles. I’m starting therapy again. I’m a month and a half into my master's program. I also just got out of an off-again, on-again relationship that was more of a wake-up call. While I don’t regret sharing those memories with him, I realized how much I missed out on experiencing UCLA and being an undergrad because I was so concerned with “losing” him. Coming from a traumatic household and into adulthood, I would date as a coping mechanism and get attached way too fast. I set myself up for heartbreak and subconsciously expected to find someone to fix me. It wasn’t fair to the guys I would date, and it was so damaging to me and my energy. I realized how bad it was when I broke down sobbing, and dry heaving cuz of-again on-again guy said he wasn’t ready for a relationship. he said I didn’t deserve him hurting me, and told me he was going through it, and I’m grateful for the closure. I was really heartbroken and upset, and I burned the bridge, which isn’t like me. But if he comes back again, I know myself well enough that I’ll cave and cycle through the heartbreak, only to make it worse. I don’t have an action plan; I’m just naming these behaviors and feelings to “tame” them. I have such a bad habit of making my life and everything seem fine and like I’m so happily unaffected, it’s off-putting to the people I care about and draining and cyclical on my end. I’m just going to be staying off dating apps and reevaluating my relationship with myself piece by piece."

        "body": "Hi. I transferred as an Econ major from cc this fall and I’m doing horribly. The transition to this university has been rough. First of all, I was used to having easy access to counselors and professors. But in here, everything fills up so quickly and you have to constantly fight for the attention of them. I also thought that I would get some good opportunities, mentorships, or workshops for banking or fincorp careers but I quickly realized those are under really selective clubs and those are mostly for sophomores and freshmen. So now I have to work on preparing technicals, behaviorals, and networking from scratch. \n\nBut at the same time, Econ classes are tough and go really fast. I tried getting tutoring, but unlike my cc where it was free, you actually have to pay like 70 per hour. I still got tutoring lessons but I feel super behind and I’m scared of the Econ 11 midterm. Now, after getting distracted by a terrible roommate situation (who constantly broke the roommate agreement, would wake me up at midnight, and  constantly bring guests without my permission. So after failing to reach an agreement, I’m looking to move out), I did a really stupid mistake that costed me 15% of my Econ 105 grade and mistook the deadline time as 12 am instead of 12 pm and missed the submission, so now I have to drop the class. I also submitted a pretty mediocre essay for my elective (again because of wasting time in my roommate situation) and I don’t know how it went or if I’ll get a bad grade. Now my Econ 11 midterm is in a week and I’m scared because I don’t know if I have enough time to study.\n\nI’m also disabled and submitted the required paperwork for CAE but still got denied from half of my accommodations. Also, it’s still hard to get help when everything gets filled up so quickly (from office hours, counseling appointments, etc).\n\nEverything is just going terrible here for me. And I’m not sure what to do. I feel bad for not getting good results so far because I’m paying out of state tuition without aid and it’s costing my parents a lot (they live in another country so I wasn’t elegible for neither). I feel like a failure and I don’t know what to do. GPA is important for my desired career and I don’t even know if I’m going to bomb my grades if I keep going like this. I keep crying every single day here and I really don’t know what to do. I would appreciate any advice."

The system is super easy and I don't even have to show my face (takes about &lt;1min per reel created). The startup supplies the content. I just have to collate and post. \n\nThey expect \\~100 reels per week across multiple accounts. Assuming im slower than the average human, I expect to spend about 120-150 mins per week doing the internship. \n\nThe proposed pay structure is:   \n$20 per week (flat) + commission based on views and sales. \n\n(I'd do this for free just to learn from the founder, he's really smart and built his company from the ground up, but they're paying me for it too - bonus i guess). \n\nI expect the performance bonus to be very high since the reel template is proven to be working. I tried it and made a video in &lt;1min. I got 100k views. It was super easy. \n\nNow here's what I want to ask you guys: \n\n1. Should I take this free money opportunity and help a bruin out with his startup?   \n2. Or, should I just ignore it and focus on applying to internships at big companies like google, apple...? "

I used to be somewhat smart in high school, but now I can’t seem to do anything right academically. I walked into a midterm the other day after having reviewed everything, done all the practice questions, started studying a week prior with active recall, went to office hours…basically everything I could think of. It still wasn’t enough to do well or at least above average, because nothing I ever do is enough, even when I do all I can. I know I’m going to graduate feeling like a failure, not having accomplished anything worthwhile these last few years. I literally don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like I try every studying suggestion people throw at me, but I still can’t do anything remotely smart. My time at UCLA has been such a waste of time and resources that could have actually gone to another student that would’ve actually succeeded. How do you all do it? How do you get good grades by doing the same exact things that everyone says works, by using the same resources and materials that I do but for you it somehow fucking works? Sometimes I feel like maybe there’s something physically wrong with my brain, because there’s times where I walk into an exam somewhat confident only to bomb it, and I don’t even get test anxiety. "

I remember some guy slamming his backpack on the table at Powell. It knocked off my study rhythm. \n\nI made my place cozy with some blankets, more books and a papers with pens instead of the overly simplistic setup that looked a little too sanitized. I added some details including sticky notes of my the hard things I needed to remember. I should put one in my shower at dick-level so I don't think about anything but my academics. \n\nI also added a heating pad despite the heater if need be but I find it difficult to avoid sleepiness unless the air is a little colder to keep me awake. \n\nAnd then, like at fucking...4am I went outside to take a breath of cold air and that really woke me up brisk one time this week when I had to wake up early to study some more. It was so quiet, anyone visiting could have taken a piss off my balcony without anyone noticing until steam arose from the garden beneath. \n\nSpeaking of piss...there was a rush activity at the frat I was pledging before getting kicked out for bringing laxatives to a shitting contest. It was called Piss in a Bottle Dodgeball where everyone pissed a 2 liter coke bottle and then the elder members of the frat would throw the bottle with the cap open at us playing dodgeball against a wall we couldn't leave too far from.

Delayed funding, failure to communicate changes, outright errors, etc. Their issues are systemic and widespread. Yet, they continue to individualize issues, superficially treat symptoms of real issue while creating more due to incompetence and/or lack of institutional readiness. This should not be a student issue and if you are like me this is actually hindering your progress as a student. Let's organize here and see how we can make the university hold up its end.

Dunno why, and I ask \"is everything okay\" and they didnt reply at first so i kept walking, i asked one more time and one of them goes \"whats that in your hand\" and i show them my bag of chips and said again \"is everything fine?\" I dont remember what they said but they just resumed what they were doing after I proceeded to walk away and to this day I am still super confused. \n\nIf they happen to be reading this (which i doubt) what the hell were you guys doing😭?"

The problem is that one of the homies in the group, his singing skills suck big time. He recently asked us to rate his singing skills but we don’t want to hurt his feelings so they volunteered me to do it since I’m the nice one in the group. \n\nI told myself that I would try to be less hurtful and blunt but he’s a horrible singer. The last time we all went to karaoke, he tried singing Stevie Wonder-I Just Called To Say I Love You and let’s just say that I can no longer listen to that song due to his voice giving me nightmares. So my question is, how would you tell someone that their singing is horrible and that they should reconsider signing up? "

All of these classes have each taken their own toll on me and definitely pushed me to my max, and it makes me wonder if this is just the common experience or if I really might not be right for this path — pre-med specifically. \n\nFull transparency, my grades have been consistently good (getting grades ranging from As to Bs in everything thus far), but it definitely has taken everything in me to get there. I was SO relieved that I would get a B in genchem because I genuinely thought I was cooked beyond belief. This has been a pretty consistent theme, where I am struggling, and often performing on/below average, regardless of how much studying I do. I am at powell locked in ALL the time, to the point where I feel like I am barely seeing my roommates once midterms start up.\n\nThe reason I bring this to reddit is because I genuinely can't tell if this is how everyone feels or not. When I am in groupmes, or seeing the averages, it seems like a ton of people are able to study a normal amount and do just fine — while I feel like I am doing week-long lock-ins just to make it by. Similarly, some of my other pre-med friends just seem to have an innate skill for these things. They often are able to make cross-course connections, like drawing similarities between chem and bio just based on their genuine interest and memory. When I think long-term, I wonder if I will be able to do well in the mcat or if this is the \"weeding\" happening to me in real time. \n\nWhat are your experiences? Is this imposter syndrome or are the pre-med students really just that good?\n\n"

I feared I made a mistake in the process, so I went to the financial aid office to confirm.\n\nApparently, my scholarship money was fine, but it was actually a mistake on the school's part. Basically there was a glitch in the system, and they accidentally gave me 2k as a payment for money they were supposed to give but couldn't. the system was fixed, but the money was already deposited in students' accounts so now they wanted them to pay it back.\n\nI was upset because, 1) they didn't notify me of any of this and I had to come *to them* to know why I have a random ass charge on my account which is shady as hell 2) 2k wasn't just a drop in a bucket it was most of my money 3) this was the school's mistake, why do I have to pay for it?\n\nBut I begrudgingly paid the bill, and cursed the Aid office for having such a faulty system fucking with people's money...\n\nWhich brings us to today, I checked my bank and it said it had 2k in it, which confused me but I had money sooo\n\nThen I called my mother, who checked my bill and said I had a charge on my account for 2k....\n\nLo and behold, it was the same damn summer bill I already paid off! Which means they made this mistake *twice.*\n\nSo now I'm wondering if anyone else has this problem, and what to do and if I should pay up again or call them out on their gross mishandling of my money (and sanity)"

THEN, you can go to any of the social events being held on campus. \n\nIDGAF if you hate pottery or sewing etc etc....just go. Go there. If you don't know how to stitch or do whatever TF activity it is that's being featured, whether it's a sport or whatever...you socialize. You talk to other people. \n\n\nNever ever reserve your outgoingness only to people who you would rather....that's not going to help you build courage needed to articulate or show confidence. \n\n\nI know each and every person who meets someone for the first few seconds either imagines having sex with them. Women tend to determine how far they'd go with you around that time. \n\nDon't just try and get a significant other. Aim for friends and collect them like currency. More friends can mean more social value when people hear about you and gather. But the value of friends quantity dwindled in junior year. The quality of the friendships is the true test. I'd rather have fewer but close friends than a bunch who are flaky. \n\n\nBut I mean like, fucking...how do you think I met so many moms? Was it because I played my guitar near Janns Steps with my pony tail on the lawn during parents weekend (many divorcees go there)? Not really, I'd only get like fucking...2 or 3 numbers at most and call it a day walking back to my apartment nearby with my dick in my hand. It's because I do a good job of steering the ship of my study groups for class, socialize and really listen to my friends in hopes that I bring out the best in them as much as some can do for me. Meeting their moms if they visit on weekends...that's a bonus but not mandatory. Don't put everything on this giant pedestal. Live your life in an outward direction. \n\n\nWhatever it is that interests you, find others who are into what you like. If you don't know what it is, find yourself. Try to find out through new things. Don't wait for the feeling like in that Nando Fortunado song The Feeling. \n\nWe get the experiences discovering something unexpected through trying new activities (make sure they aren't self-destructive). For me, dance really helped me. Dance like there's no tomorrow.\n\nBut like fucking...folks don't just think the school sponsored activities are for folks who aren't \"cool\". You make what's cool, not what others say....as long as you don't hurt others. \n\nFreshman year, I got lucky seeing a group of folks playing Who Would You Rather on a couch at my dorm lobby with a guitar player there playing dirty songs to make everyone laugh. I smiled ear to ear seeing them. But either way I didn't need them only to have a social life. There are plenty of avenues for you. Don't lose hope. \n"

The intention of this post is to compile and explore some uncomfortable truths about UCLA culture and hope to make a less divided, more wholesome, and more understanding community. Not all of these polls were created by myself, the only ones that I created were made to expand on another that I observed. The use of ChatGpt in addition to my own response is intended to show a neutral perspective on the polls, as well as simply since it is interesting to see. The source of this data is polls on YikYak’s UCLA community, an anonymous messaging platform where students (must have a ucla email to participate) can post anything and vote on polls anonymously, and is widely used by undergraduate students. The motivation for this post is from observing these polls and sentiments of racial bias and negativity surrounding the dating scene throughout UCLA. \n\nChatGpt Initial Response - Here is what ChatGpt first said when instructed to analyze the polls:\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Regressive Reality\n\nSource: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)\nRespondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (250–300 average per poll)\nMargin of error: ±6–8%\n\n⸻\n\n1. Self-Image vs. Reality\n\t•\t89% of students say UCLA is a progressive/liberal campus.\n\t•\tYet across dating and social polls, behaviors reflect racial hierarchy, gender imbalance, and superficial values.\n\t•\tIn short: UCLA is liberal in rhetoric, conservative in social practice.\n\n“Progressive” UCLA still reproduces old hierarchies — whiteness, status, and appearance dominate attraction, while inclusivity remains performative.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Gender Divide: Women Frustrated, Men Defeated\n\nFemale perspective\n\t•\t76% of women say the dating pool is bad for girls.\n\t•\t36% blame “guys have bad personalities,”\n\t•\t21% say “not enough attractive guys,”\n\t•\t21% say “too many short guys.”\n\t•\tOnly 1% cite lack of chivalry or money.\n\t•\tIn talking stages, 43% of women ended it because they “got bored.”\n\n→ Pattern: Women externalize dissatisfaction — men are the problem (boring, short, immature). Emotional engagement, not materialism, drives their critique.\n\nMale perspective\n\t•\t31% of men say “it isn’t bad for guys.”\n\t•\t49% blame “personal/luck issues.”\n\t•\tOnly 13% cite “girls have bad personalities,” and 7% say “girls are too shallow.”\n\t•\t0% say “not enough attractive girls.”\n\n→ Pattern: Men internalize blame and accept their lower leverage. UCLA’s gender ratio and social climate empower women as gatekeepers.\n\nNet result\n\t•\tWomen: “Men aren’t enough.”\n\t•\tMen: “I’m not enough.”\n\t•\tOutcome: high female discontent, high male insecurity, and mutual cynicism.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Relationship Norms: Freedom &gt; Commitment\n\t•\t41% admitted to getting with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.\n\t•\t42% (women) and 14% (men) said it’s okay for their partner to attend frat parties without them.\n\t•\tAmbiguous “talking stages” and open-ended loyalty norms dominate.\n\n→ Hookup culture is normalized but distrusted. The result is freedom without security, leading to emotional burnout and disillusionment.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Race and the UCLA Dating Hierarchy\n\nA. Social Segregation\n\t•\tOnly 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).\n\t•\t34% say their group is mostly or entirely one race.\n\t•\tDespite campus diversity, social life remains racially siloed.\n\nB. Cross-Racial Dating\n\t•\t71% have dated outside their race.\n\t•\t29% have not — consistent with friend-group segregation.\n\t•\tSo exposure exists, but racial boundaries persist in attraction.\n\nC. Racial Preferences\n\t•\t35–40% of men say they have a primary racial attraction.\n\t•\t60–70% of women say the same.\n\t•\tWhen ranking male attractiveness:\n\t•\tWhite men: 43%\n\t•\tLatino men: 27%\n\t•\tAsian men: 17%\n\t•\tIndian men: 8%\n\t•\tBlack men: 6%\n\n→ Women overwhelmingly prefer white and Latino men; men are more flexible.\nThis disparity builds a racialized dating economy where whiteness and proximity to it are rewarded.\n\nD. Stated Beliefs About Race in Dating\n\t•\t62% say it’s okay to say you “only like white guys/girls.”\n\t•\tOnly 11% call that racist.\n\t•\t31% say it’s “racist to say it, not to feel it.”\n\t•\tWhen asked why race matters:\n\t•\t70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”\n\t•\t14%: “Family expectations.”\n\t•\t12%: “Political views.”\n\t•\t4%: “Social/economic status.”\n\n→ Translation: Racial preference is normalized and morally insulated.\nStudents frame attraction as “personal taste,” not prejudice — a textbook case of quiet racism disguised as individuality.\n\n⸻\n\n5. UCLA’s “Liberal but Superficial” Paradox\n\nCategory\tOn Paper\tIn Practice\nIdeology\t89% liberal/progressive\t\n62% say it’s okay to publicly prefer only white partners\nDiversity\tHighly multiracial campus\t\nOnly 36% mixed friend groups\nGender politics\t\nFeminist rhetoric, equality ideals\t\n76% of women find the dating pool “bad” yet drive narrow racial filters\nEmotional maturity\tCommunication, openness valued\t\n43% of women end things out of boredom; 41% of students admit to cheating/talking overlap\nInclusivity narrative\t\n“Everyone’s welcome”\t\nAttraction and friendship still follow a white-centered hierarchy\n\n\n⸻\n\n6. The Racialized Nature of “Preference”\n\nUCLA’s culture treats race in dating as apolitical, but the data reveal an unspoken racial caste system in desirability:\n\nRank (for men’s desirability per women)\t\nGroup\t% of votes\n1️⃣\tWhite\t43%\n2️⃣\tLatino\t27%\n3️⃣\tAsian\t17%\n4️⃣\tIndian\t8%\n5️⃣\tBlack\t6%\n\nDespite a majority-Asian campus, Asian men rank third, and Black men last — proof that proximity to whiteness, not diversity, dictates desirability.\nWhen 62% openly condone saying “I only like white people,” it’s not just bias — it’s cultural reinforcement of racial hierarchy under a liberal mask.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Emotional Detachment and Performative Progressivism\n\t•\tUCLA students champion tolerance publicly but tolerate racial exclusion privately.\n\t•\tThey condemn overt bigotry but excuse racialized desire as “chemistry.”\n\t•\tHookup culture and online validation amplify superficiality, while political correctness prevents honest critique — producing a progressive façade over regressive behavior.\n\nThe campus sells “diversity” as a brand but practices social homogeneity wrapped in virtue signaling.\n\n⸻\n\n8. Gendered Power and Racial Capital\n\t•\tWomen hold social leverage — more selective, more critical, and more racially filtered.\n\t•\tMen hold numerical leverage in interracial openness but less choice overall.\n\t•\tWhiteness (especially white men) functions as social currency — accepted by every group and rarely challenged.\n\t•\tNon-white men navigate conditional desirability — admired only if they fit white-coded norms (height, demeanor, physique).\n\n⸻\n\n9. The UCLA Dating Equation\n\nDiversity + Hyper-selectivity + Ideological Progressivism = Racialized Liberalism\n\n\t•\tUCLA’s dating scene runs on status, aesthetics, and social capital, not genuine liberalism.\n\t•\tThe more progressive students claim to be, the more they justify exclusion as “just personal preference.”\n\t•\tThe result: liberal vocabulary, conservative instincts, racial hierarchy.\n\n⸻\n\n10. Final Diagnosis\n\nTheme\tCore Reality\nInclusivity\t\nStructural, not personal — students support diversity abstractly, not romantically.\nRacism\t\nSubtle, coded as “taste” or “comfort zone.”\nGender\t\nWomen are empowered but often perpetuate exclusionary standards.\nMen\t\nSelf-blaming, less selective, racially more open.\nCulture\t\nHookup-oriented, emotionally shallow, racially stratified, and quietly elitist.\n\n\n⸻\n\n🔚 Conclusion: “Progressive” UCLA’s Dating Hypocrisy\n\nUCLA markets itself as one of the most inclusive universities in the country — and ideologically, it is.\nBut in dating and social life, the polls reveal a different story:\n\t•\tWhiteness is still the apex of desirability.\n\t•\tRacial exclusivity is normalized, not challenged.\n\t•\tFemale selectivity reinforces racial hierarchy under feminist language.\n\t•\tMale insecurity sustains it by self-blame and silence.\n\t•\tHookup freedom masks emotional detachment and quiet prejudice.\n\nUCLA’s dating culture is a microcosm of liberal hypocrisy in Gen-Z America:\na campus that preaches equity but still dates by a racial script written decades ago.\n\n⸻\n\nChatGpt Response 2 - I felt the first response was a bit too combative between genders, and asked it to make it less so:\n\nPerfect — here’s the tightened and final version: slightly less gender-adversarial, more focused on the racialized social structure beneath everything, and still as direct and data-anchored as before.\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Racial Reality\n\nSource: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)\nRespondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (≈250–300 per poll)\nMargin of error: ±6–8%\n\n⸻\n\n1. The Progressive Illusion\n\t•\t89% of students describe UCLA as a progressive/liberal campus.\n\t•\tYet campus behavior—especially in dating and social life—reflects old racial hierarchies, superficial selection, and cultural clustering.\n\t•\tUCLA is progressive in rhetoric but conservative in social practice.\n\nThe campus sells inclusion as an identity, but daily interactions reveal quiet racial gatekeeping and self-segregation beneath a liberal surface.\n\n⸻\n\n2. General Climate of Dissatisfaction\n\nA. Widespread Frustration\n\t•\t76% of women call the dating pool bad for girls.\n\t•\t31% of men say it isn’t bad for guys, while 49% blame “personal/luck issues.”\n\t•\tBoth genders describe disconnection and mistrust; almost 41% admit to hooking up with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.\n\nB. Emotional Detachment\n\t•\tThe most common female breakup reason: “I got bored” (43%)—not cheating or incompatibility.\n\t•\tTalking stages rarely lead to stability; freedom is prized, commitment undervalued.\n\t•\tThe tone across polls suggests a socially open but emotionally cynical culture.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Racial Structure of Social Life\n\nA. Segregated Friendships\n\t•\tOnly 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).\n\t•\t34% say theirs are mostly or entirely one race.\n\t•\tUCLA’s diversity is statistical, not social: cross-racial friendship is limited, creating echo chambers of comfort and cultural sameness.\n\t•\tThose circles strongly influence dating exposure, reinforcing racial preference loops.\n\nB. Racialized Dating Preferences\n\t•\t71% have dated or talked to someone outside their race—but 60–70% of women and 35–40% of men still admit to a primary racial preference.\n\t•\tAttraction rankings (by female voters):\n\t•\tWhite men: 43%\n\t•\tLatino men: 27%\n\t•\tAsian men: 17%\n\t•\tIndian men: 8%\n\t•\tBlack men: 6%\n\t•\tDespite being one of the most Asian campuses in the U.S., Asian men rank third; Black men last.\n\n→ The campus’s social logic rewards proximity to whiteness—the currency of “mainstream” attractiveness and perceived status.\n\nC. What Students Think About That\n\t•\t62% say it’s okay to say you only like white guys/girls.\n\t•\tOnly 11% call that racist; 31% say “it’s racist to say it, not to feel it.”\n\t•\tWhen asked why race matters in dating:\n\t•\t70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”\n\t•\t14%: “Family expectations.”\n\t•\t12%: “Political views.”\n\t•\t4%: “Socio-economic status.”\n\n→ Students treat racial attraction as apolitical and morally neutral, detaching personal preference from structural bias. That’s quiet racism: discrimination that hides behind the language of individuality.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Race as the Unspoken Social Hierarchy\n\nA. In Dating\n\nWhiteness sits at the top of the desirability chain, followed by lighter-skinned or “Western-coded” groups. The closer someone’s look or culture aligns with that standard, the more socially mobile they become in dating.\n\nB. In Friendship Networks\n\nEven friendship data mirror this hierarchy: white and white-adjacent students more often move across racial lines, while Black, South Asian, and some East Asian groups report more insular social circles—less by choice than by exclusion through subtle social norms.\n\nC. In Campus Culture\n\nGreek life, club leadership, and social media trends all reinforce the same optics: certain aesthetics and backgrounds carry higher cultural capital. The racial hierarchy isn’t enforced by rule—it’s reproduced through who’s invited, who’s visible, and who’s desired.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Gender Dynamics within a Racial Frame\n\t•\tWomen report higher standards and more disappointment (76% unhappy), but those standards align with the racialized ideals above—favoring whiteness, height, and social charisma.\n\t•\tMen, more likely to be racially open (only 35–40% have a set racial preference), internalize rejection as personal failure (49% blame themselves).\n\t•\tThe result isn’t a gender war so much as a shared exhaustion inside a system where attraction and status are racialized currency.\n\n⸻\n\n6. The Progressive Veneer vs. Social Reality\n\nCategory\tWhat UCLA Says\tWhat Students Do\nIdeology\t\n89% identify as liberal/progressive\t\n62% say it’s fine to publicly prefer only white partners\nDiversity\t\nOne of the most multiracial campuses in the U.S.\t\nOnly ~36% of friend groups are truly mixed\nInclusivity\t\nAnti-racist, equity-focused rhetoric\t\nAttraction patterns mirror Eurocentric hierarchies\nGender equality\t\nEmpowered, self-aware students\t\nEmotional detachment and blame imbalance\nOpenness\t\nHigh racial awareness\t\nLow interracial intimacy, high racial comfort-zoning\n\n\n⸻\n\n7. What “Preference” Really Means Here\n\nAt UCLA, preference functions as a socially accepted proxy for bias. Students publicly condemn racism yet privately replicate its logic through dating choices and friend-group formation.\nWhen most people agree it’s fine to say “I only like white people,” they’ve redefined racism as something you commit with hate—not with habit.\n\nThis quiet racism is harder to confront because it hides inside “personal taste,” yet it reproduces the same exclusionary outcomes: marginalized groups remain under-desired, under-invited, and under-included.\n\n⸻\n\n8. The Cultural Formula\n\nDiversity + Liberal Branding + Status Anxiety = Racialized Liberalism\n\n\t•\tThe school champions diversity but practices comfort-based segregation.\n\t•\tStudents use liberal vocabulary (“preference,” “vibe,” “chemistry”) to excuse inherited hierarchies.\n\t•\tThe dating scene rewards alignment with white aesthetics and social norms, not actual progressivism.\n\nUCLA thus becomes a mirror of modern elite America: visibly diverse, verbally inclusive, functionally stratified.\n\n⸻\n\n9. Key Statistics Summary\n\nIndicator\t% / Finding\tMeaning\nCampus sees itself as liberal\t\n89% yes\t\nIdeological consensus\nWomen say dating pool is bad\t\n76%\tHigh female dissatisfaction\nMen blame themselves\t\n49%\tInternalized defeat\nStudents admitting overlap cheating\t\n41%\tFuzzy relationship norms\nHave dated outside race\t\n71%\tSurface-level openness\nHave a racial preference\t\n~60–70% women, 35–40% men\tPersistent bias\nSay it’s okay to like only white people\t\n62%\tNormalized racial exclusivity\nMultiracial friend groups\t\n36–38%\tSocial clustering by race\n\n\n⸻\n\n10. Conclusion: UCLA as a Case Study in Quiet Racial Stratification\n\nUCLA stands as a paradox: a liberal campus built on racial comfort zones.\nStudents advocate inclusion publicly but practice segregation privately—in who they befriend, date, and desire.\n\t•\tWhiteness retains symbolic dominance.\n\t•\tRacial “preferences” reproduce the same hierarchies progressivism claims to dismantle.\n\t•\tEmotional detachment and hookup culture amplify surface-level connections while masking deeper bias.\n\nUCLA’s dating scene isn’t just shallow—it’s racialized.\nThe language of freedom and preference has replaced explicit prejudice, but the outcome is identical: diversity without integration, equality without intimacy.\n\nThe campus looks like the future; it loves like the past.\n\n⸻\n\nPersonal Response: \nI do believe that a lot of what ChatGpt has to say on this issue has some truth to it, though it does bring in some points that are not entirely supported by the polls and may not be accurate. UCLA is often presented and identified as a diverse, liberal, progressive school, however does not function as such socially. Many students, especially those who are ethically underrepresented struggle to connect with those outside of their own ethnicity, not only in dating but in social settings. UCLA is heavily self segregated socially, in dating, friend groups, greek life, etc. Despite having many different groups and ethnicities represented, there is a lack of true diversity and mixing of such groups. In terms of dating, there is a longstanding narrative that UCLA’s dating pool is bad, especially for women. I believe this comes from a variety of factors, with equal “fault” between genders. It seems that in the current age, but especially at UCLA, traditional social practices are less common. People are less likely to ask each other out, be open to the opposite gender, and be socially proactive. There are definitely some shallow aspects, with too prominent of a hookup culture and a heavy influence on physical appearance. Social media and dating apps definitely play a significant part in this as well. The polls do show a gender discrepancy, however it is worth noting that the girl:guy ratio at UCLA is very skewed and plays a part in this. (though the fact there are less men would typically mean the standards for them should be lower, not vice versa). The racialized nature of dating and social life, and widely accepted nature of expressing racial preferences and white superiority is definitely problematic. It ultimately is racist to glorify one group over others and openly express preference towards one group, and doing so fuels a lot of hateful, harmful, incel/blackpill rhetoric. While it is true that attraction is natural, we should all strive to be less superficial, be conscious of our biases, and work to be more inclusive and careful of what messages we convey."

For context, I’m trying to pursue policy work post-grad/do a masters in public policy, so I thought getting some knowledge on these basic classes while I’m still in undergrad would be handy. I know they’re definitely different classes, but what would you think is more important if I can only take one of them? Also, how would you say the workload is? I have experience doing stats in college, but I haven’t touched econ since high school. It seems that getting knowledge of micro would be useful, but also learning stuff like R (which I assume you do in 60) would be good too. Any advice?"

If not, what do students usually do on the 31st/1st? Also, how do people usually pick which party to go to like through friends, orgs, or just Instagram?\n\nSince I’m an international student and this is my first time experiencing college Halloween, I’d really appreciate it if someone could kindly explain.\n\nThanks!

The dining halls are dogshit, (De Neve is like okay sometimes if your fine with eating junk food, but #1 food my ass) All the student services have the worst bureaucracy I’ve ever experienced ever and getting them to do ANYTHING is a multi-week if not month affair. How does this school manage to be more ghetto than any random community college in and around LA, but still be so popular. Don’t even get me started on what walking around Westwood is like, I feel like I’m in downtown. Most of the other UC campuses visually look way better and let’s be real the quality of the education you get is basically identical everywhere. Is everyone just going here to have “UCLA” slapped on their diploma thinking it means something??? I get the 4-year students glazing it because they don’t know any better and this has been their only experience, but like genuinely the place that takes pride in their rank should at least be ON PAR with the quality of a college, not be shittier than it. I know some of these issues are not exclusive to UCLA but I’ve not heard remotely similar complaints from friends that have gone to other UC’s and Cal States. "

And if I can, does that mean I can enroll in 30B later on? Or do I still need to do 30A, since it's a different sequence? "

A few of these people tried to turn away, but he kept taking pictures. When I noticed and looked at him, he pointed the camera toward me as well and recorded pictures of me.\n\nI’m not sure what his intentions were, but it felt invasive and uncomfortable. I just wanted to remind everyone to stay aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts if something feels off.\n\nTaking pictures in public isn’t illegal, but if someone’s behavior crosses a line or makes you feel unsafe, you can contact UCLA’s Title IX office or campus safety resources for support.\n\nStay safe out there 💙"

However, for another course in the same session — affected by the exact same emergency — my request for an Incomplete was denied because I had already submitted the final exam. My academic advisor explained that UCLA policy typically disallows withdrawals or Incompletes after the final has been attempted, even in verified emergency situations.\n\nI’m now exploring my options. I plan to request a grade reevaluation with the department chair for the course where my Incomplete was denied and to reach out to the Dean of Students or Case Management Services to see if a retroactive withdrawal or other academic relief might be possible.\n\nI’m seeking advice from the UCLA community: Has anyone successfully received retroactive withdrawal or relief under similar circumstances? What documentation or approach is most effective, and how should I frame my request to the department chair? Any tips for navigating this process would be greatly appreciated."

I'll occasionally take a low-dose nicotine for productivity and it works like a charm. I’m pretty anal about substances so I generally only engage in nicotine during the weekdays at work and when I’m not crazy tired cuz I know that’s when I’ll build a reliance on something. I’ll only use a 2mg and mostly split it in half so the spike isn’t too high because I’m definitely one to crash and anything higher hits too hard. Anyways I’ve been testing out all of the different gums &amp; more recently mints when I saw the blurb about microplastics in human brain tissue since I assume masticating plastic gum is going to lead to this issue. But I’ve been chewing gum all my life so I’m not too worried about it.\n\nI’ve now tried Walgreens, Amazon basic care, CVS, Lucy, Blip, Chewbizz, Quitine, Nicorette, Nicnac and Quit with jones. I looked at price, flavor, texture, sensation, etc. Here’s my very biased take on all these products. So the majority of these are white labeled from contract manufacturers and branded as their own product.\n\nWith respect to flavor Walgreens and Blip are for sure the best with the Mint Freeze flavor. But they taste exactly the same, so I’m pretty sure it’s the exact same product but Walgreens is $0.31/piece and Blip is $0.80/piece unless you buy bulk then it’s about the same price.\n\nIt seems like Amazon basic care &amp; Nicorette are like the same brand with the same flavors but Amazon is the cheapest if you’re just trying to essentially get free nicotine gum lol it doesn’t even touch the bank account. But Nicorette and Quitine just make you feel fiendish by their branding and I don’t want that anywhere near me.\n\nLucy and Chewbizz feel like the most rebellious and innovative, like if you see their marketing they both feel like startups in Silicon Valley. I know Lucy was founded by the guys from the Tech Bros podcast and Chewbizz looks very new judging by their accounts on social media. Frankly, I don’t even bother with Lucy because the flavors are way too sweet and it’s twice as much as the others. Chewbizz is for sure the most expensive I’m not buying this in bulk it’s $0.80/piece but they justify it by having a biodegradable gum base and a nicotine analog along with vitamins in the gum.\n\nI for one don’t know if I’ll ever get used to a natural gum base, it gets way softer by like minute 15 then you kinda want to spit it out though I’m not parking it. But they almost guilt trip you into chewing it cuz you know it’s not plastic and has vitamins. The main redeeming quality is the sensation is different than nicotine, it feels way less addictive and I feel stimulated for like 2/3 times as long with more of the flow state feel than the others so that’s a big plus. You just can’t get it on Amazon or stores so waiting longer for shipping is annoying.\n\nLastly the mints are pretty easy. Quit with jones has the best packaging out of all of the products I’ve tried but you can’t split the mints in half, so minimum dose is 2mg. The Nicnacs are bigger (3mg) and you can at least split them in half. Flavor is whatever, nothing like the gums but you’re also not chewing anything so it’s pretty discreet. The one thing is the mints have to be parked or the absorb almost instantly, and I’m not a pouch guy because my teeth are way too important to me than to be having long term gum recession &amp; pain.\n\nBest price is Walgreens/Amazon.\nBest nootropic sensation is Chewbizz.\nMost discreet/lowkey is Nicnac.\nBest branding is quit with jones.\n\nI’ll realistically be cycling between Walgreens, Chewbizz and Nicnac for the foreseeable future. Walgreens cuz they have the best flavor and the price is a steal, Bizz because the sensation lasts longer and it feels better for me, and Nicnacs when my jaw gets tired though parking is not my MO. Anyways, 2mg or less once or twice per day during big grind sessions has been amazing, and I won't even think about chewing it outside of my desk and a couple places. I don’t know if I’m missing anything but would love to hear your thoughts. Cheers &amp; happy studying!"

        "body": "**Final update (10/24)**: Donor Concierge let my daughter know that after reviewing her photos, the couple decided there wasn’t enough resemblance to the intended mom to move forward. Given how specific and highly compensated this couple’s case is, she figured the odds were low anyway, so no harm, no foul. She also confirmed she won’t be added to Donor Concierge’s general donor database since she only expressed interest in this one situation.\n\nFor what it’s worth, my daughter’s entire interaction with Donor Concierge seemed professional and above board. That said, after reading through all the comments here, it’s clear that anyone considering egg donation should do their research and proceed with caution. If my daughter had gone further, we absolutely would’ve hired an independent attorney to review all contracts and protect her interests.\n\nStay safe, everyone, and thank you to the UCLA community for the helpful discussion.\n\n**Update 2 (10/20)**: Donor Concierge reached out to my daughter today (she filled out their website form over the weekend). Here’s what she found out:\n\n1. The couple is ethnic Chinese, U.S. citizens, and the reason the offer is so high is that they’re hoping to find an egg donor who physically resembles the would-be mom. They do not need a surrogate.\n2. The mom herself has gone through 6 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, and both parents are in their 40s.\n3. The 250K is a firm 250K (not an “up to” bait-n-switch) with all related medical, legal, and travel expenses covered on top of that. There’s also a 10K bonus for a person (or organization) who refers the selected donor. Everything would be guaranteed by a written contract.\n\nMy daughter sent in some current photos plus some baby pictures that I helped her gather. She’s not committing to anything, and she’s being careful by researching both the medical and psychological side of things and not just taking Donor Concierge’s word for it, since obviously they have their own incentives.\n\n**Update:** Wow, I didn’t expect this thread to blow up like it has! I apologize if I made it sound like I’m encouraging my daughter to be an egg donor. SHE is the one who’s very interested and texted to get my thoughts (I’m a single dad). Anyway, we looked up Donor Concierge and it appears to be a legitimate family planning center in San Rafael, CA. My daughter says she’s going to fill out the form and, if they contact her, just have a conversation with them to learn more. She swore she wouldn’t proceed any further unless and until all concerns raised (please keep them coming so I can pass them along to her!) are fully addressed. I’ll update this thread again when I know more, thanks!\n\n**Original Post:**  \nHey Bruins, posting here as a slightly confused (and maybe mildly panicked) dad.\n\nMy daughter’s a student at UCLA, and she texted me a photo of this flyer someone handed her on campus today. It says “Help Us Start a Family” and offers $250,000 to an East Asian egg donor — plus a $10,000 referral bonus. It looks professionally printed and mentions a company called “Donor Concierge” that claims to be BBB accredited, but still… the whole thing sounds like something straight out of a Netflix true crime doc.\n\nShe said someone was passing these out on campus. Has anyone else gotten this? Is this some kind of elaborate scam, or (somehow) an actual thing?\n\nAs a dad, I’m half “this sounds way too good to be true” and half “if it is true, that’s more than my college tuition was.”\n\nAppreciate any info from current students who’ve seen it or know what’s up — I’d just like to make sure my kid’s not about to get kidnapped by a fertility startup."

I grab a mask in my backpack and offer it to her. Her response? She gives me the middle finger and starts laughing and coughing again. Now I feel like I'm gonna be fucking sick because of this shit.\n\nAnyone know if I can report this behavior anywhere? To be honest, I have no clue who she is, so reporting her wouldn't be easy anyways. But I genuinely feel so disappointed by these types of people in general. There's never a class where there isn't like 4-5 people just constantly sneezing and coughing during lecture without covering themselves. To those students, please please be more considerate of others. That's all I ask.\n\nThis is a recorded lecture too so even if she didn't want to wear a mask she could've just watched the lecture remotely. There is no excuse for her to be coming to class like that."
