The supervisor is a researcher on staff at a lab on campus and I am working in the lab through work-study.\n\nThe behaviors include divulging personal problems and information to pressure me to increase my hours, pressuring me to not study for exams or to lower the time I‚Äôm studying so I can work, telling me to prioritize working in the lab over family and school, questioning my commitment to the lab when I express a need to study instead of work or if I become sick and am unable to attend work, and expecting me to work on complex tasks without training or proper PPE/required trainings before being legally able to work in the lab.\n\nI just started this job and have already experienced a lot of pressure and inappropriate behavior and I just need to know who I can report this to and get advice on how I can handle this going forward.\n\nThank you.

Mine was decently expensive &amp; I guess they knew that &amp; went on a day at a time when they figured I wouldn‚Äôt be there. I‚Äôd appreciate it if you guys could report this to the campus but I suspect they already know about it. Some people walking by just told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs a recurring thing‚Äù very casually so I really doubt UC cares about it at all. "

I'm extremely introverted and whenever i try to make friends I either never say anything impressionable or I kinda scare them off by saying something strange. It's partially my fault that I don't go out my apartment unless its to class or gym. Pretty regularly, a girl will compliment my style or say I'm pretty and I just have the urge to ask them if they wanna be friends but my mind goes blank because im so bad at talking to people so i just say thank you and walk away. Other times I'll admire a girl in the gym and i want to go up to her and make friendly conversation but when I smile at them, they won't even smile back. And in class or in clubs, everyone already had designated friends and aren't looking to talk to anyone except for the people they already know or they just kind of hold a surface level conversation with you and you never talk to them again. I don't really know what to do at this point. "

For reference, I‚Äôm taking Chem 1A, Biol 5A, and Calc 7B right now. Next quarter I imagine I‚Äôd only be assigned Chem 1B, Biol 5B, and their labs (I don‚Äôt need any more calc). So I don‚Äòt see any point in staying with my LC and having no say in my professors. Right now I have Naderiyan for calc and Hill for chem and I genuinely hate it. Do you guys have any advice?"

I dont know the complete details but i just know that the ex gf and the dude bestie were very close and hung out one on one like a lot and eventually they hooked up. Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol. \n\nBut ya, i mean i would love to hear your guys thoughts cuz i def think a lot of ppl here and in general are completely fine with platonic friends which i agree, but like when youre dating, i personally would start to hope she would spend more time with me than them cuz well im her bf right?

I‚Äôm currently a 3rd year here at UCR and as much as I love this school, I unfortunately haven‚Äôt had much of a chance to be social and make friends. I‚Äôve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I‚Äôd post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! \n\nHere‚Äôs a little about me! \n\nI (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don‚Äôt get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it‚Äôs one of my favorite past times. I‚Äôm also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I‚Äôm specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven‚Äôt played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I‚Äôm starting to watch more horror movies, so I‚Äôll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I‚Äôm just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out! \n\nReddit might not be the best place for this typa thing, but it‚Äôs worth a shot! Have a good day/night and good luck with midterms coming up everyone! :) "

This study aims to learn about students' direct experiences with attaining accommodations, what barriers they may have faced, if any, and how the institution has or has not addressed those barriers. The goal of this project is to advocate for best practices by looking at both the undergraduate student and Teaching Assistant (TA) perspectives. Participation in the survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete if all questions are answered, but you can skip questions or select \"prefer not to answer\" if you don't want to provide certain pieces of information. Participants must be 18 years or older to complete the survey.\n\nHere is the link to the undergraduate student survey: [https://forms.gle/JkwF81JXdA3PsqQN9](https://forms.gle/JkwF81JXdA3PsqQN9)  \nand TA survey: [https://forms.gle/For1owH2dsntEdKa6](https://forms.gle/For1owH2dsntEdKa6)\n\nMore information on the study details, and potential risks, etc, are on the first page of the survey. If you have any questions, please dm me! Also please share the surveys if you know anyone they may apply to!

Then I realized it was for SI leaders only before getting kicked out AGAIN. I then decided to go back in one last time so I could get referred to the right place. The dude told me to go to an SI session to find out then proceeded to kick me and ban me. Like I understand you wanna have a little private chat for SI leaders only, but I thought the purpose of SI leaders were to answer questions for those who have them? I got my chemistry questions ready and my test coming soon but I can't get a single ounce of help from the 20 SI leaders available in that group chat? Instead all I got was a ban and I don't know what I should do to get help (office hours don't work, my classes interfere).\n\nLike even if you can't refer me to the right server or do anything about my questions, couldn't you just dm me when I first came in with my questions that this wasn't the right server and refer me an email to the TA who is in charge of chemistry?\n\nThank you for your time üò≠"

I‚Äôm a bit of a big lad (about 5'8\", maybe a little fat, idk), and those chairs just *hit different*.\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôd definitely tip the electrical engineer if they could add one more charging tower near the round seating area.\n\nI‚Äôm a transfer and a commuter, so I don‚Äôt really have the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù of being close to campus or enjoying everything UCR has to offer.\n\nIDK THE ENERGY COSTS HERE AT THIS BUILDING, but think of it this way. you're bizz coffee shop is a damn hit, i'm sure UCR can afford the extra 100w power... (delicious coffee and food btw)\n\nBut hey, if there‚Äôs ever a part-time electrical engineering position, sign me the *fuck up* as well. \n\nCheers, everyone! Here‚Äôs to a successful year. Stay positive, stop bullying each other, and smile more. Thanks. \n\n[GO HIGHLANDER BEARS??? What is it again?]"

I just wanna have at least a couple women I can just talk and hang out with, without any kind of expectation of romantic or sexual stuff. Is this dynamic on campus something that goes away later in the year, and does anyone else feel like this?"

I was homeschooled (non-religious purposes) and then did only school for high school. I did one year of community college in which time I had two in person classes. I would consider myself well adapted and not a weird person at all (exclusively due to having online friends). I'm very academically driven and a thoughtful person. but honestly it feels like that latter bit is to a fault. I feel like I overthink EVERYTHING. I can't do small talk. the only thing I talk to anybody about is name, major, and school related things. I'm also an introverted person, not to an extreme extent but I don't overshare and I find it hard to express myself very hard. it also doesn't help that I'm 18 and in my third year, although I know this isn't really a huge factor.\nIt feels like every \"normal\" person in this school already has a group of friends to talk to. I feel such a barrier to trying to talk to these people even though they're the people I'd actually want to talk to. there's this dude who was at my transfer orienation and is now in 2 of my classes, so I'm like \"I should probably talk to this guy\" but he already has his group of friends and I just don't know how to do it. I'm NOT really an awkward person, I just have walls up it feels like and it's so frustrating.\nthe only people I can easily chat up are people in my classes who are not very social. and no offense, but most of them are just kind of weird. I started off sitting at the front of classes because I wanted to succeed and connect with professors, and I'm now finding myself a couple rows back because I just feel like I can't connect with the people in the front for the most part. and then I can't connect with the people further back either who are actually sociable so I don't know what to do.\nI also joined a club (ACM) but (also no offense) it's the same archetype of people I don't really care to socialize with. I'm in one of the projects so hopefully there are cool people in that when it starts but I just don't know.\neveryone feels so connected already, or not connected at all. I want to be the former but I'm drifting towards the latter and I hate it.\nhonestly all my self confidence is shot right now. I don't know. hopefully this changes soon but it's just so hard to make friends here for me."
