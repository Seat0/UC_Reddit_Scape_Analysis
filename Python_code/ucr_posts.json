I have 64 AP credits so technically \u201csophomore status\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure how easy or difficult it would be for me to register for classes on my own. I just really don\u2019t like the schedule I was assigned, because I commute. Having classes 5 days a week with varying times of morning and afternoon is really inconvenient.\n\nI am a bit hesitant though because I worry about not being able to register for classes and also not being eligible for RISE. For reference, I\u2019m taking Chem 1A, Biol 5A, and Calc 7B right now. Next quarter I imagine I\u2019d only be assigned Chem 1B, Biol 5B, and their labs (I don\u2019t need any more calc). So I don\u2018t see any point in staying with my LC and having no say in my professors. Right now I have Naderiyan for calc and Hill for chem and I genuinely hate it. Do you guys have any advice?",

Your LC is designed in a way where everyone in it is in a similar state as you or have similar majors, so you can help each other and study with each other. But, ofc, if you feel you aren\u2019t fitting in or able to get close to anyone in an LC, you are more than welcomed to leave. Something I didn\u2019t like when I was an LC in particular was they picked horrible schedules for me (8am classes all freshmen year) but I really enjoyed the people within my LC, and I\u2019m still close to them after 3 years. Heck, one of the guys in the LC helped me get into a research lab and into volunteer opportunities off campus. I would suggest try to get close or study with your LC if you can, see how this quarter turns out and then decide winter quarter if you want to stay or not like the other redditor said",

Every person who wins a suit against a police officer has it thrown out on appeals, this is why people sue the department or cities since they dont get qualified immunity. Qualified immunity allows a police officer to fire his gun into a locked front yard at a dog at a party full of children \"For no reason\" according to the supreme court, who also said but qualified immunity protects him because \"Firing your gun into a crowd of children for no reason was not previously found to be a violation of rights\" They then proceeded to not make that case a violation, meaning it can happen again.

I dont know the complete details but i just know that the ex gf and the dude bestie were very close and hung out one on one like a lot and eventually they hooked up. Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol. \n\nBut ya, i mean i would love to hear your guys thoughts cuz i def think a lot of ppl here and in general are completely fine with platonic friends which i agree, but like when youre dating, i personally would start to hope she would spend more time with me than them cuz well im her bf right?

And the academic advisors are not the best nor most helping. That being said there are some things that only an academic advisor can help you with (holds, academic probation etc etc.) but when it comes to registering for classes they are not the most knowledgeable!   \n  \nThats where I come in!!! I am a senior now and thought I would try and help relieve some of the registration stress  that I had when I first started college!! Not B.S. Just trying to help people out before I graduate!!!

        "body": "Hey everyone, I hope you take a moment to read this and maybe share some encouragement or advice. I just transferred to UCR from the Bay as a 3rd-year, and I was *so* excited to get started \u2014 but honestly, it\u2019s been tough facing what feels like transfer judgment.\n\nI\u2019m a really outgoing person, and I\u2019ve been putting myself out there these past few weeks, going to a lot of recruitment events for both professional frats and clubs. But it\u2019s been discouraging getting dropped just because I\u2019m a 3rd-year transfer \u2014 like, that\u2019s not something I can control. It sucks feeling like I\u2019m being judged for my year instead of what I can actually bring to the table.\n\nI know I only have two years here, so I\u2019ve been trying to make the most of it, but it\u2019s hard when it feels like people overlook you for freshmen who have \u201cmore time.\u201d Honestly, my community college felt more welcoming than this \u2014 it\u2019s been a real culture shock.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m still going to keep putting myself out there because I don\u2019t want to give up, but I can\u2019t help feeling a little discouraged. Has anyone else gone through this? I swear I\u2019m friendly and really don\u2019t like just staying in bed doing nothing \u2014 I just want to find my people here.\n\nPS: I have never faced rejection so its harder TT",

The environment here is SOOO different from the Bay, it's been really tough for me to acclimate, too.",

He was influenced by right-wing conspiracies like Gamergate. \n\nWe also have the burning of Judge Diane Goodstein's home where a fire was started at her South Carolina home. The Judge ruled against Trump administration policies.\n\nStudies have shown that MAGA Republicans are more likely to incite more violence than the left.\n\nI like how you mention Jesus because didn't he say, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" - Matthew 22:39? Because well loving God is first and loving your neighbor as yourself? \n\nBecause God literally created us as equals and he loves us in our own way. As shown with John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,\" because he sacrificed his own son to save the world and it implies that Jesus has love to all of humanity and we need to take that to heart. Because he did not just love you. He LOVED everyone.\n\nWe also see this in Matthew 25:35-40, \"For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me... Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.\" Where the whole concept of this is caring for strangers which is often interpreted as people of different backgrounds like immigrants is equivalent as caring for him. Implying that his love is for everyone. Not just you or me.\n\nSo tell me, where in the Bible that uphold what MAGA did that I mentioned earlier? To me it is not those of what Jesus has taught us.",

Just to make it easier for me to understand, since you mentioned all of those points. But provided little to no evidence other than your own statements and belief in supporting someone who will not support you back. Unlike what I did. Then let me try to find evidence to see if you are right? \n\n1. Charlie Kirk Death: \n\nCharlie was never killed by a Democrat. In fact, he was killed by a person named Tyler Robinson, aged 22 years old, who had a republican upbringing. He was never affiliated with the Democratic Party in any way. In fact in his Utah Voter records show him as unaffiliated and inactive. In fact, the killing was condemned by the Democrats. With Obama and Kamala sharing their condolences to Charlie's family on X. Something that Republicans wish to always ignore.\n\n2. \"Democrats Support transgender giving them drugs that mess up their brains and bodies\"\n\nThis is misleading and inaccurate. Democrats do give access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth, which does include puberty blockers and hormone therapy. However, it is checked and reviewed by the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These treatments are reversible for the blocks and are partially reversible for hormones, which are prescribed after evaluation with a professional doctor. Study also shows that it improves mental health, reduces depression, anxiety, which are often comparable to cisgender people of the same age. It just seems that you ignore that evidence, and it just comes from pure hatred of the Democratic Party. \n\n3. \"Democrats Support men in women's sports\"\n\nYeah, this is partially true, but you kinda oversimplify. Democrats have opposed outright bans on transgender athletes in sports. The Biden administration wanted to ask for rules for having restrictions on transgender athletes, keeping it fair in any sport. However, it is not killing anyone, so I do not know why you give it any energy. Plus, most of the international sports that people watch are not regulated by the U.S. government but their own organization, like FIFA with Soccer.\n\n4. \"Democrats Support illegals, sex traffickers, murderers\"\n\nThis is false, just straight up false. Democrats want humane immigration policies. This includes a better way for undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship to reunite them with their families. They have backed border security, for instance, with Biden's 2024 executive action reducing illegal crossings. The only thing they disagree about is mass deportations. There are no sources of any Democratic policy that have endorsed sex traffickers or murderers, and both parties are in agreement with cracking down on crime. \n\n5. \"Democrats Support murdering unborn babies (60 million) more than all wars total\"\n\nYou are almost accurate with the numbers. Roe v. Wade gives us an estimate of 63 million abortions in America. So you are accurate about that. However, Democrats do not support murdering babies. They support abortion rights as healthcare, and democrats advocate for restoring this access and view it as violating bodily autonomy. The label about murder is more of a moral stance and not a factual one. While the U.S is right now pumping money to Israel for it's genocide killing babies and children, also while they are doing that cutting benefits for under privelege kids and people. Very \"pro-life\" indeed. Also in the bible, Mary gave HER consent to have his CHILD. Which is something that a lot of rapists do not do. \n\n6. \"Democrats kill Christians\"\n\nI genuinely could not find any sources on that, as there are literally none. There is more violence against Democrats, like the 2025 shootings of Minnesota legislators, or when we have Christian extremism targeting others. It is just baseless fearmongering at this point.\n\n\n7. \"Democrats let protesters into the capital, capital police killed a unarmed woman\"\n\nFalse? This is so false, I can't believe you actually believe this? The Trump Supporters literally breached the barriers, and the police force was overwhelmed. Ashli Babbitt was unarmed and was shot by Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd while trying to climb through a broken door towards the speaker's lobby, where all of the lawmakers were sheltered. Democrats condemned the riot while Trump wanted the rioters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\n8. \"Democrats tried to kill trump twice\"\n\nFalse, really, we have Thomas Matthew Crooks, who is a registered Republican who attempted to kill him in July 2024. Then we have Ryan Wesley, who is an independent voter who has no association with any parties. Both were lone actors.\n\n9. \"Democrats are trying to kill police\"\n\nThis is False, as there is no evidence to suggest this. Most democratic policies are just cutting police budgets. However, they refunded or increased the funding when crime rises. Biden's American Rescue Plan also provided $350 million for police hiring. Democrats aren't assaulting police officers. Assaults on officers only grew because of issues outside of politics.\n\n10. \"Democrat states have The highest crime rates\"\n\nThis is very misleading, as crime rates have to do with urban density, poverty, and guns. Not politics. Cities like Memphis, which has a republican mayor, or St. Louis, which is Democratic, are high in crime. A lot of Democratic cities are not soft on crime. \n\n11. \"90% of republicans are Christians.\" \n\nThis is false, there was a study done by the Public Religion Research Institute did a poll where it is actually, \"the Republican party, the largest group is white Christians (68%), including 29% who are white evangelical Protestants, 19% who are white mainline Protestants, and 17% who are white Catholics, compared with 16% who identify as Christians of color. The remainder of Republicans (16%) identify as religiously unaffiliated (12%) or as Jewish (2%), Hindu (1%), or belong to other non-Christian religions (1%).\"\n\nYour last statement of needing to read the bible more. Yeah, everyone does? I do not hate people for who they are. Or associate people just because of who they vote for. I do not hate anyone, nor do I intend to imply that I am trying to hate you. However, I have seen Republicans using the bible to justify their hatred. Which is something that I do not like. You seem to care more about feelings than facts. When you are supposed to think critically rather than being fed by MAGA and their propaganda. It is to the point where MAGA are worshipping Trump like he is Jesus, and that is blasphemy. \n\nPlease do more research in the bible and actually critically think rather than absorb Media like a black hole.",

My point is also literally based off of what happened last year, where protest footage was used to paint protesters as violent and unreasonable, and bolstered support for trump for many demographics outside of California. It didn\u2019t even bring about meaningful change, in fact u can argue that things got worse and that these behaviors convinced the White House to bring the military into DC. I think protesting is a great idea, but if u don\u2019t think critically about who you\u2019re yelling at and are just yelling at everybody, you make it very easy to make your entire cause to look bad.

There wasn't a club or anything and it seems like some folks are keen on having one, so I made a discord for fellow bakers and foodies. If y'all want to post your yummy creations, want to exchange baked goods/recipes/advice, or look to sample freebies feel free to join! Anyone of any skill welcome!\n\n[https://discord.gg/z3AkCEg8](https://discord.gg/z3AkCEg8)",

        "body": "Hey guys! This is probably a lowkey embarrassing post, but I\u2019m not sure where else to turn to. I\u2019m currently a 3rd year here at UCR and as much as I love this school, I unfortunately haven\u2019t had much of a chance to be social and make friends. I\u2019ve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I\u2019d post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! \n\nHere\u2019s a little about me! \n\nI (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don\u2019t get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it\u2019s one of my favorite past times. I\u2019m also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I\u2019m specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven\u2019t played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I\u2019m starting to watch more horror movies, so I\u2019ll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I\u2019m just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out! \n\nReddit might not be the best place for this typa thing, but it\u2019s worth a shot! Have a good day/night and good luck with midterms coming up everyone! :) ",

I saw that they didn\u2019t do it for 2026 and im very scared about winter 2027. I will finish my requirements fall 26 and want to start at ucr winter 27 and not fall behind since I am a premed major and need a gap year for MCAT as well. Also because I have heard it\u2019s easier to get accepted In the winter compared to fall because more people are applying so it could get competitive. I am either thing to transfer as a biology or neuroscience major. Which one do yall recommend? Is neuroscience really hard? Or is it okay, which one would you recommend for me a premed student?",

You get more counter space for the kitchen too. They also have an ice maker inside their freezers and gas stoves rather than an electric one if you prefer that. The apartment overall felt bigger. It\u2019s the same price as North District 2, but the amenities are a lot better and it\u2019s a shorter walk to campus. North District 2 has lofted twin beds for every floor plan and the shower floor is flat and connects to the actual bathroom floor so water gets everywhere even with a shower curtain. They spent a lot of money making the outside look nice and not on the actual apartments themselves. I would say the only pro of North District 2 is that it\u2019s ran by UCR and not privately owned by another company.",

In christianity, our core belief is that god is the only true way through heaven, and no one on this earth surpasses god. (John 14:6). Thus any christian claiming a human figure to be close to the level of god, or to do X or donate Y because of the lord, you can easily conclude that they are cults. There are plenty of smaller christian clubs that are fantastic if anyone needs recs.",

Asking chat gpt as if it were your TA, asking it to do a problem and explain the reasoning and concepts behind the problem and why this has to be the answer. Reading the book may help with understading a practice problem, but with being in teh quater syste,m you need to take advantage of ways to learn concepts faster, an dthast by practice problems, which includes your homework. People skimp on the HW, but its litterally there to help reinforce the concepts. And get you into the habit of being a problem solver. Every problem you have, look and see why this has to be the answer, and the thought process and concepts necessary to do so. It'll only help you if you do so.",

But I\u2019m awaiting my next paycheck so that I can buy some setup for a server to host this.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a broke individual and I\u2019m essentially using entirely free services, I\u2019m just having this system scan primarily the Riverside shelters (Coachella Valley Animal Campus, Riverside County West Animal Shelter, and the San Jacinto Shelter)\n\nBut if anyone\u2019s interested in helping these animals find a home.

Also don't fall into the trick of \"botting\" where u can solve problems through memorizing steps. Learn with purpose and think about each part of the process, trust me it helps alot if u build it early on.",

He arrived and immediately decided he wanted to rebrand the athletics department as the bear with the half blue face (an homage to the Mel Gibson movie Braveheart, which was something former AD Stan Morrison came up with during the somewhat painful transition to Division 1. The idea was that we might lose, but we wouldn't quit. That logo fell out of favor because people couldn't understand why the bear had a half blue face.)\n\nI always called this logo the \"Zombie Bear\" because it looked like a cross between the mascot and a zombie from the Walking Dead comics.\n\nIt went away when the campus did another rebrand in 2020, getting us our current logo and colors.\n\nWickstrom left UCR for Louisiana Monroe and is now at some small school in Kansas. His legacy was an idea to build a new arena, called the C-Center, that was going to be financed by a \"Chinese millionaires\" in exchange for work visas. The idea was shot down by then Chancellor Kim Wilcox about 7 days into his tenure as chancellor.",

Past years though, it feels like that energy\u2019s kind of faded, and I\u2019m wondering what it would take to bring it back to life.\n\nFor those who used to hang there (or still do):\n- What made The Barn special to you back in the day?\n- What would actually get you to go again if they tried to revive it?\n\nWould things like these help?\n\t\u2022Live music or open-mic nights\n\t\u2022Affordable eats and drinks that don\u2019t feel too \u201ccampus exclusive\u201d\n\t\u2022Local breweries or food pop-ups\n\t\u2022Community events that blend students and locals\n\t\u2022Or just a more relaxed, authentic vibe like it used to have\n\nI\u2019d love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts \u2014 especially from current students, alumni, longtime Riverside residents, or anyone who remembers what made The Barn the hangout spot.

Not so easy to find live bands to fill up a consistent schedule anymore. I would stop by for a beer way more often if they would lower their prices, but I don't know if thats super viable as younger students don't drink or socialize as much as they used to. Another enormous issue is the parking at UCR. Parking has become so predatory that I don't even go near the place if I don't have to.",

The bar before hand was just poorly managed by a guy who only got the job cuz his dad owned the bar, the bartenders who worked there were not experienced bartenders, just students hired from campus. there also has been a push in management to get the barn to be a hangout spot, the managers are just negligent to what the actual student body wants and instead just kinda focuses on what will save them the most money. Meal swipes were taken away and given to noods, and the hours they\u2019re open were cut due to a severe lack of people coming. When i first started, the barn was open till 9. when i left it closed at 7 since no one would come past then.  The bar now is owned by an actual professional company so hopefully there will be an increase in people who do come to the bar. ALSO last year, the Barn lost their main event manager due to a case being opened against her for racist comments towards employees. Ever since then, events havent been scheduled as frequently due to management \u201cnot being able to handle it\u201d but also losing a lot of the connections the manager who got fired had access too. almost all of the bands and groups that performed were organized by her. Long story short, the barn IS trying but there are lots of factors that are effecting them, especially with the loss of money from meal swipes",

From there, they basically make you move in with them, work for them, and give them all your money.\n\nHaving faith is like having genitals: it's fine to have them (and even be proud of it). When you start taking it out in public, shoving it in someone's face, and trying to force it down someone's throat, you are an ass. \n\nMany religions even speak about your relationship with God should be a private one.

Instead of stressing about how hard it might be you need to realize that you really can do whatever you put your mind to and I promise you that if you put in effort you will definitely see results. \n\nI know it is scary starting college but I\u2019m telling you, you can do this. Just take it one step at a time, be involved with your classes, ask for help, go to office hours, makesure you understand stuff and if you don\u2019t understand it then do practice problems until you can do it without even thinking twice. I promise you got it if you just put in the effort. Anyone can learn anything with enough practice! \n\nLike I said I\u2019m really not trying to be rude, but how much easier are you hoping a degree to be? If you want to excel in business or accounting it\u2019s a lot of math, not necessarily complex math but it\u2019s a lot of numbers (especially accounting) so you should try to get comfortable with it now.",

I don\u2019t usually keep my keys in my pocket (usually in my backpack) and of course the one time i put it in my pocket they fall off. I lost it around linden / canyon crest drive sidewalk on the way to class.
