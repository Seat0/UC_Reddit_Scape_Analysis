As someone who doesn\u2019t come from a wealthy background, this is deeply concerning. I\u2019ve worked hard toward my dream of becoming a physician, but with this cap, I genuinely don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll afford medical school. It\u2019s not just about me\u2014this will make it so much harder for people from underserved communities to become the doctors, lawyers, or CRNAs who are desperately needed. Schools claim to value diversity and equity, but how can they uphold that when only the wealthy can realistically access these professions? It\u2019s hard not to feel like this bill is actively working against the future of people like me\u2014and, in some ways, against the future of America itself. I can only imagine the disaster this would cause and wreck the economy as their will be a shortage of doctors in the field. Or how would medical schools would take this into consideration for their applicants",

Combined with wearable data, real-time vitals, and vast medical knowledge, AI can offer faster, cheaper, and more consistent care, and insurance companies are salivating over this (why pay a human for the work when AI is cheaper). \n\nVirtual AI consultations will soon handle colds, infections, and chronic disease management, escalating only complex cases to human doctors. As healthcare systems face rising demand and doctor shortages, AI offers scalable relief. GPs won\u2019t vanish, but AI will become the first line of care for most.\n\nSo, unless you plan on becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon, figure out how to leverage AI to your benefit, or find another career path altogether. You don\u2019t need to go into all that debt and have significantly less opportunity for well-paying jobs in the field you\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into.",

Yes, you're not trying to change the debater's mind, but in the eyes of the average, uneducated, vibes based American voter, the debate creates an aura of legitimacy to people like Kirk. Fuck that shit. We need to stop doing that shit. They need to be shouted at and ridiculed because they're hateful fucking assholes. There is no debating people like that. We need to spread the message to stop debating people like Kirk and ridicule and humiliate them. Press them on their cruelty and hatefulness no matter what. Do not give them ammo to legitimize themselves in the eyes of the public. The public need to see that their positions are wholly unpopular, hateful, and gross. Never debate them in good faith.",

I know morals will always be subjective, but genuinely, if you went up to a pro life man/woman and say you aborted babies for fun, vs you went up to a POC man and say you hate his race, we all know that one case is more likely to result in your shit getting rocked. These morals that the stereotypical right wing person hold are clearly not as based on feelings and experience that the average leftist tends to hold. There are certainly conservative people that mean well, I\u2019m not trying to dehumanize all conservatives, but like genuinely when it comes to the bigotry spewed by the right vs the \u201cmoral wrongdoings\u201d of the left, it\u2019s so infuriating how much of it is propaganda induced morality. I know I\u2019m saying a lot of obvious stuff but it\u2019s genuinely like fighting an uphill battle, for the average left leaning person to be forced to be nonemotional when outspoken right wing trolls spew shit for fun.

People are embarrassing themselves by making excuses for their own stupidity and silence. Or keep hoping that censorship and ignoring it will make it just go away, that's working fucking great.",

But Alisa Perales, who just turned 11 years old this month, will be preparing for her next big step: Going to UC Riverside.\n\n&gt;The girl from San Bernardino already made history in her Inland Empire community as she became the youngest person to graduate from Crafton Hills College, a community college in Yucaipa, with a degree in multiple sciences and another in mathematics.\n\n&gt;The college said she would have earned two more associate degrees, in physics and computer science, if she stayed for one more semester.\n\n&gt;Instead, Allisa will be pursuing her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science at UC Riverside in September.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment,\u201d the whiz kid said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to move onto a new school and meet new friends.\u201d\n\n&gt;Sending her off to a four- year college is also a rewarding outcome for her father, Raphael Perales, who spotted her love of learning at an early age.\n\n&gt;After mastering basic ABCs and 123s by her first birthday, Alisa was ready to expand her knowledge, so her father homeschooled her until when it became the time for Alisa to start Crafton Hills College at age 8.\n\n&gt;\u201cShe\u2019s been different her whole life, but I have always taught her that there\u2019s nothing out there she\u2019s not capable of understanding,\u201d the father told the community college before the graduation.\n\n&gt;Raphael insisted that he did not set out a rigorous schedule or goal for the young girl. Rather, he said he simply followed her lead as the girl\u2019s thirst for knowledge and interest in school grew.\n\n&gt;\u201cI responded to what she was interested in and helped feed that interest and fueled that fire,\u201d the proud father said.\n\n[Source](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/11-year-old-graduate-college-uc-riverside-whiz-kid-allisa-perales/3711672/)",

It's a great achievement but these stories are really just hyping up getting a degree as early as possible (way too early), which imo is a disservice to both someone as young as her and devalues the college experience. Going to college is more than just getting some paper degree, it's about getting an experience in multiple facets. It's about classes, meeting people and taking advantage of experiences and opportunities. At 11 can she even take advantage of internships? I know in California teens can't work until like 16 and even then need like permission from parents and school. My brother when trying to get a job in high school couldn't land one, and it took the combo of Covid + a local restaurant getting desperate for workers to hire him on in the back kitchen. She's also pretty much not gonna have dating life. Also if she does make friends, a lot of those older friends/classmates are not gonna be comfortable sharing more adult topics with someone who isn't even 13 yet. Unlike others she also can't sign leases or open a credit card on her own, etc. Just seems like going to college when you can't even legally drive yet is robbing yourself of a more richer experience. But I wish her luck and hope she truly enjoys it",

Rather than finishing those associates degrees, she's transferring to UCR to pursue a bachelor's degree, which if the schedule holds shed be finishing by age 13. I'm assuming since she can't work because of child labor laws she'll just go straight into a graduate program. Still, how an infant starts talking and learning their ABCs before 12 months is pretty wild, like i don't even know how that's possible. 12 months is when most babies are locking down object permanence.",

Like once a kid has language figured out, you can kind of force feed em education probably faster than k-12, but a ton of k-2nd grade is like still kind of learning the English language to some extent. Idk how she had like a child development rate like 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule, like that actually doesn't make sense. Most babies aren't unable to speak English at 12 mot because they are stupid but because an infants brain is not fully developed for like the first 3 years. Like this kids infant brain development is highly unusual.",

Its better at measuring how close you were born to Europe or america and how much money your parents made when you were a kid than it is at measuring your intelligence.\n\nThe other thing is autism isn't a super power and you're not like helping people with autism by suggesting that is is.\n\nThe thing about learning and education is you really just need to know how to read and write and the will to put in the work, but anyone can learn anything. Like we sort of act like only smart people can major in math or physics or engineering, and like that's bullshit. Most math and engineering students couldn't complete a philosophy pr literature major and the reason isn't lack of intelligence, it's lack of desire to read like 1000 pages per week of old ass books. Similarly most majors couldn't finish a chemistry degree mostly because they just don't have the will do the math and stuff. Any grad student will tell you though, once you've completed one program, you realize you could probably do any other if you had the desire to put in the work on a subject. Really this is mainly what the k-12 system sort of sets kids up to do, you're just learning how to learn and sort of doing reps go build stamina. Its not implausible for a child to sort of reach this point much earlier earlier than age 17 or 18, the k-12 system is meant to educate all the kids together at the same time which can be somewhat inefficient and inconvenient for specific individuals, but that's not like an IQ thing. Some kids, poor kids usually, have a hard time focusing all of their life on school when they have to grapple with a more harsh reality that wealthier ones.\n\nWhat's surely impressive about this girl is her very early infant development. Baby humans have this weird thing where we're born like partially developed mainly in the brain department. Most animals are born with the ability to walk and feed themselves, humans are born kind of at this medium of the maximum size of a skull that a mother's birth canal can facilitate, but a baby is still at a level of development that in most other animals would still be in utero. You're first like 36 months are really like kind of intense brain development to be happening outside of a womb or an egg, we're talking developing the cognition like object permanence a full year after having been born. Some how this girl had already allegedly mastered the ABCs by 12 months when normally a baby shouldn't have the capacity for speech beyond mama and dada at that point. That's not a point of intelligence, that's a point of why does your 12 month old have the developed brain of a 3 year old. At any rate, if sounds like she was able to effectively start kindergarten at age 3 or 4 instead of 5 or 6 and she did it with a home school program, which anyone whos taken one will tell you can blast through a GED equivalent in just a few years if you can read and write English effectively. Blasting through k-12 education in 4-6 years is basically what students at the remedial schools to (the like you got kicked out of normal high school so now you're in last chance school to still get a high school diploma by age 17-19 even though your starting at like age 14-17. Its wild that this girl was able to start doing this at age 3 or 4, but given that she was it's plenty plausible for her to be in college. Really the big question is how did she have like such a developed brain at 12 months.",

Unfortunately people will say oh it\u2019s what the kids says they want to do, which may be true, but often times could say that because they want to make their parents happy. I mean look at a lot of the childhood actors now, they expressed this as well. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good or a bad thing, but it definitely does come with some negatives. \nA famous case of this actually is the Unabomber weirdly enough he went to college at a young age and expressed feeling very isolated from his peers and ended up seeking validation from some bad actors.\nEnd of the day nothing is ever all good or all bad, but many of the worlds brightest scientist and thinkers experienced childhood and so on in a somewhat normal order and didn\u2019t take away from their contributions.\n\n*edit due to typos",

However I think there\u2019s a tenancy for bright, intellectual kids\u2014and this applies to many MIT students (including myself) not just the prodigies\u2014to over-emphasize the intellect, become hyper, rational, and apply logic to everything. (I\u2019m talking about people interested in math and science specifically, as with this girl.) \n\nWhen one\u2019s identity hinges on being highly intellectual, it\u2019s a huge hit to the ego when one discovers that they are not developed in other areas of life. A common response is just to double down on the intellectualizing. What we end up with is an academic system filled with professors who think they\u2019re the smartest people in the world, but really only know how to think and not relate to people and thus actually miss out on most of the world. I think doing good science relies on being a balanced person who can understand that reality isn\u2019t just the intellect or the physical or the measurable. There\u2019s definitely a difference between knowledge and wisdom. \n\nWe have too many very knowledgeable experts with no wisdom it seems. Just look at what humans have done with technology in the past 50 or 100 years; as a species we race into technologies we aren\u2019t wise enough to use well. Isn\u2019t it interesting how new technology is always used by the military first? Nuke, autonomous drones, GPS\u2026 At this point I\u2019m ranting a bit. \n\nObviously, plenty if not, most people end up branching out. But if you look at the professors who occupy top seats and academia, you\u2019ll find the type of people I\u2019m talking about. Ultimately many intellectual people end up being very self-serving and that they are just studying things that they\u2019re interested in, which is great, but so much effort and resources are put into things which are contributing to warfare or don\u2019t matter at all. Why not really try to grow as a society? I hate to see genius distorted by an ill society instead of geniuses healing society and removing said distortion.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an ideal situation for children like that. But then again there\u2019s hardly ever an ideal situation for anybody. Certainly we can do better than allowing an 11-year-old to pursue one college degree after another. The intellect is clearly already hyper developed, take advantage of a young plastic brain to develop other areas to make a more balanced human. Of course, the path of least resistance for her is to continue being praised for her success and continue an academia. I\u2019m just doubtful that route will be the most elucidating for her self discovery in the long run.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? I\u2019m not sure but I think it\u2019s integral education. We need to develop the mind, body and spirit of an individual and not just their mind. The ecosystem of academia is not conducive to that in its current state, but it can be if we change it. As for this 11-year-old right now? I think she has enough degrees and college experience already.",
