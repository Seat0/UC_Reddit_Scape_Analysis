I have 64 AP credits so technically \u201csophomore status\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure how easy or difficult it would be for me to register for classes on my own. I just really don\u2019t like the schedule I was assigned, because I commute. Having classes 5 days a week with varying times of morning and afternoon is really inconvenient.\n\nI am a bit hesitant though because I worry about not being able to register for classes and also not being eligible for RISE. For reference, I\u2019m taking Chem 1A, Biol 5A, and Calc 7B right now. Next quarter I imagine I\u2019d only be assigned Chem 1B, Biol 5B, and their labs (I don\u2019t need any more calc). So I don\u2018t see any point in staying with my LC and having no say in my professors. Right now I have Naderiyan for calc and Hill for chem and I genuinely hate it. Do you guys have any advice?",

Your LC is designed in a way where everyone in it is in a similar state as you or have similar majors, so you can help each other and study with each other. But, ofc, if you feel you aren\u2019t fitting in or able to get close to anyone in an LC, you are more than welcomed to leave. Something I didn\u2019t like when I was an LC in particular was they picked horrible schedules for me (8am classes all freshmen year) but I really enjoyed the people within my LC, and I\u2019m still close to them after 3 years. Heck, one of the guys in the LC helped me get into a research lab and into volunteer opportunities off campus. I would suggest try to get close or study with your LC if you can, see how this quarter turns out and then decide winter quarter if you want to stay or not like the other redditor said",

Every person who wins a suit against a police officer has it thrown out on appeals, this is why people sue the department or cities since they dont get qualified immunity. Qualified immunity allows a police officer to fire his gun into a locked front yard at a dog at a party full of children \"For no reason\" according to the supreme court, who also said but qualified immunity protects him because \"Firing your gun into a crowd of children for no reason was not previously found to be a violation of rights\" They then proceeded to not make that case a violation, meaning it can happen again.

I dont know the complete details but i just know that the ex gf and the dude bestie were very close and hung out one on one like a lot and eventually they hooked up. Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol. \n\nBut ya, i mean i would love to hear your guys thoughts cuz i def think a lot of ppl here and in general are completely fine with platonic friends which i agree, but like when youre dating, i personally would start to hope she would spend more time with me than them cuz well im her bf right?

Are we studying for hours in tbe library? Probably fine. Am I going over to her dorm and getting drunk alone with her? Not fine. Rule of thumb: don't get into intimate or potentially intimate situations (one on one in a private setting with lots of locked doors and convenient beds) with someone other than your partner.\n\n\nI feel like a lot of this is common sense.",

I remember when I was stressing myself out freshman/sophomore year trying to make sure I get all the classes I need to graduate but had no one older than me to ask for advice and help.  And the academic advisors are not the best nor most helping. That being said there are some things that only an academic advisor can help you with (holds, academic probation etc etc.) but when it comes to registering for classes they are not the most knowledgeable!   \n  \nThats where I come in!!! I am a senior now and thought I would try and help relieve some of the registration stress  that I had when I first started college!! Not B.S. Just trying to help people out before I graduate!!! Message me if you need help or have any questionnss!!  \n",

        "body": "Hello everyone!  I just moved to Oban Family Housing, and my fianc\u00e9 is a PhD student at UCR. I\u2019m an adult learner who recently got my learner\u2019s permit. I\u2019m working toward my behind-the-wheel test after not needing to drive for many years in NYC/Europe.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a female UCR student with a valid California driver\u2019s license who\u2019d be willing to ride with me about 2 hours a week while I practice driving in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s (licensed) car.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to teach me or be an instructor: just a calm, licensed passenger while I practice and build confidence. I\u2019d offer a small weekly payment (around $15/hr) for your time and company.\n\nWe could meet in a public area if that would make you more comfortable, and I\u2019m flexible on days and times. \n\nIf you\u2019re friendly, responsible, and would like to make a little extra cash, please DM me!\n\nThanks so much and stay safe out there!",

I just transferred to UCR from the Bay as a 3rd-year, and I was *so* excited to get started \u2014 but honestly, it\u2019s been tough facing what feels like transfer judgment.\n\nI\u2019m a really outgoing person, and I\u2019ve been putting myself out there these past few weeks, going to a lot of recruitment events for both professional frats and clubs. But it\u2019s been discouraging getting dropped just because I\u2019m a 3rd-year transfer \u2014 like, that\u2019s not something I can control. It sucks feeling like I\u2019m being judged for my year instead of what I can actually bring to the table.\n\nI know I only have two years here, so I\u2019ve been trying to make the most of it, but it\u2019s hard when it feels like people overlook you for freshmen who have \u201cmore time.\u201d Honestly, my community college felt more welcoming than this \u2014 it\u2019s been a real culture shock.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m still going to keep putting myself out there because I don\u2019t want to give up, but I can\u2019t help feeling a little discouraged. Has anyone else gone through this? I swear I\u2019m friendly and really don\u2019t like just staying in bed doing nothing \u2014 I just want to find my people here.\n\nPS: I have never faced rejection so its harder TT",

As shown with John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,\" because he sacrificed his own son to save the world and it implies that Jesus has love to all of humanity and we need to take that to heart.

He LOVED everyone.\n\nWe also see this in Matthew 25:35-40, \"For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me... Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.\" Where the whole concept of this is caring for strangers which is often interpreted as people of different backgrounds like immigrants is equivalent as caring for him. Implying that his love is for everyone. Not just you or me.\n\nSo tell me, where in the Bible that uphold what MAGA did that I mentioned earlier? To me it is not those of what Jesus has taught us.",

Just to make it easier for me to understand, since you mentioned all of those points. But provided little to no evidence other than your own statements and belief in supporting someone who will not support you back. Unlike what I did. Then let me try to find evidence to see if you are right? \n\n1. Charlie Kirk Death: \n\nCharlie was never killed by a Democrat. In fact, he was killed by a person named Tyler Robinson, aged 22 years old, who had a republican upbringing. He was never affiliated with the Democratic Party in any way. In fact in his Utah Voter records show him as unaffiliated and inactive. In fact, the killing was condemned by the Democrats. With Obama and Kamala sharing their condolences to Charlie's family on X. Something that Republicans wish to always ignore.\n\n2. \"Democrats Support transgender giving them drugs that mess up their brains and bodies\"\n\nThis is misleading and inaccurate. Democrats do give access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth, which does include puberty blockers and hormone therapy. However, it is checked and reviewed by the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These treatments are reversible for the blocks and are partially reversible for hormones, which are prescribed after evaluation with a professional doctor. Study also shows that it improves mental health, reduces depression, anxiety, which are often comparable to cisgender people of the same age. It just seems that you ignore that evidence, and it just comes from pure hatred of the Democratic Party. \n\n3. \"Democrats Support men in women's sports\"\n\nYeah, this is partially true, but you kinda oversimplify. Democrats have opposed outright bans on transgender athletes in sports. The Biden administration wanted to ask for rules for having restrictions on transgender athletes, keeping it fair in any sport. However, it is not killing anyone, so I do not know why you give it any energy. Plus, most of the international sports that people watch are not regulated by the U.S. government but their own organization, like FIFA with Soccer.\n\n4. \"Democrats Support illegals, sex traffickers, murderers\"\n\nThis is false, just straight up false. Democrats want humane immigration policies. This includes a better way for undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship to reunite them with their families. They have backed border security, for instance, with Biden's 2024 executive action reducing illegal crossings. The only thing they disagree about is mass deportations. There are no sources of any Democratic policy that have endorsed sex traffickers or murderers, and both parties are in agreement with cracking down on crime. \n\n5. \"Democrats Support murdering unborn babies (60 million) more than all wars total\"\n\nYou are almost accurate with the numbers. Roe v. Wade gives us an estimate of 63 million abortions in America. So you are accurate about that. However, Democrats do not support murdering babies. They support abortion rights as healthcare, and democrats advocate for restoring this access and view it as violating bodily autonomy. The label about murder is more of a moral stance and not a factual one. While the U.S is right now pumping money to Israel for it's genocide killing babies and children, also while they are doing that cutting benefits for under privelege kids and people. Very \"pro-life\" indeed. Also in the bible, Mary gave HER consent to have his CHILD. Which is something that a lot of rapists do not do. \n\n6. \"Democrats kill Christians\"\n\nI genuinely could not find any sources on that, as there are literally none. There is more violence against Democrats, like the 2025 shootings of Minnesota legislators, or when we have Christian extremism targeting others. It is just baseless fearmongering at this point.\n\n\n7. \"Democrats let protesters into the capital, capital police killed a unarmed woman\"\n\nFalse? This is so false, I can't believe you actually believe this? The Trump Supporters literally breached the barriers, and the police force was overwhelmed. Ashli Babbitt was unarmed and was shot by Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd while trying to climb through a broken door towards the speaker's lobby, where all of the lawmakers were sheltered. Democrats condemned the riot while Trump wanted the rioters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\n8. \"Democrats tried to kill trump twice\"\n\nFalse, really, we have Thomas Matthew Crooks, who is a registered Republican who attempted to kill him in July 2024. Then we have Ryan Wesley, who is an independent voter who has no association with any parties. Both were lone actors.\n\n9. \"Democrats are trying to kill police\"\n\nThis is False, as there is no evidence to suggest this. Most democratic policies are just cutting police budgets. However, they refunded or increased the funding when crime rises. Biden's American Rescue Plan also provided $350 million for police hiring. Democrats aren't assaulting police officers. Assaults on officers only grew because of issues outside of politics.\n\n10. \"Democrat states have The highest crime rates\"\n\nThis is very misleading, as crime rates have to do with urban density, poverty, and guns. Not politics. Cities like Memphis, which has a republican mayor, or St. Louis, which is Democratic, are high in crime. A lot of Democratic cities are not soft on crime. \n\n11. \"90% of republicans are Christians.\" \n\nThis is false, there was a study done by the Public Religion Research Institute did a poll where it is actually, \"the Republican party, the largest group is white Christians (68%), including 29% who are white evangelical Protestants, 19% who are white mainline Protestants, and 17% who are white Catholics, compared with 16% who identify as Christians of color. The remainder of Republicans (16%) identify as religiously unaffiliated (12%) or as Jewish (2%), Hindu (1%), or belong to other non-Christian religions (1%).\"\n\nYour last statement of needing to read the bible more. Yeah, everyone does? I do not hate people for who they are. Or associate people just because of who they vote for. I do not hate anyone, nor do I intend to imply that I am trying to hate you. However, I have seen Republicans using the bible to justify their hatred. Which is something that I do not like. You seem to care more about feelings than facts. When you are supposed to think critically rather than being fed by MAGA and their propaganda. It is to the point where MAGA are worshipping Trump like he is Jesus, and that is blasphemy. \n\nPlease do more research in the bible and actually critically think rather than absorb Media like a black hole.",

It didn\u2019t even bring about meaningful change, in fact u can argue that things got worse and that these behaviors convinced the White House to bring the military into DC. I think protesting is a great idea, but if u don\u2019t think critically about who you\u2019re yelling at and are just yelling at everybody, you make it very easy to make your entire cause to look bad.

        "body": "Hey guys! This is probably a lowkey embarrassing post, but I\u2019m not sure where else to turn to. I\u2019m currently a 3rd year here at UCR and as much as I love this school, I unfortunately haven\u2019t had much of a chance to be social and make friends. I\u2019ve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I\u2019d post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! \n\nHere\u2019s a little about me! \n\nI (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don\u2019t get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it\u2019s one of my favorite past times. I\u2019m also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I\u2019m specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven\u2019t played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I\u2019m starting to watch more horror movies, so I\u2019ll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I\u2019m just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out! \n\nReddit might not be the best place for this typa thing, but it\u2019s worth a shot! Have a good day/night and good luck with midterms coming up everyone! :) ",

Also because I have heard it\u2019s easier to get accepted In the winter compared to fall because more people are applying so it could get competitive.

Posting here is a solid first step! It would be cool if we made a discord server:)",

        "body": "Hi, I\u2019m a freshman bio major and I\u2019m really considering leaving my LC after this quarter. I have 64 AP credits so technically \u201csophomore status\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure how easy or difficult it would be for me to register for classes on my own. I just really don\u2019t like the schedule I was assigned, because I commute. Having classes 5 days a week with varying times of morning and afternoon is really inconvenient.\n\nI am a bit hesitant though because I worry about not being able to register for classes and also not being eligible for RISE. For reference, I\u2019m taking Chem 1A, Biol 5A, and Calc 7B right now. Next quarter I imagine I\u2019d only be assigned Chem 1B, Biol 5B, and their labs (I don\u2019t need any more calc). So I don\u2018t see any point in staying with my LC and having no say in my professors. Right now I have Naderiyan for calc and Hill for chem and I genuinely hate it. Do you guys have any advice?",

Your LC is designed in a way where everyone in it is in a similar state as you or have similar majors, so you can help each other and study with each other. But, ofc, if you feel you aren\u2019t fitting in or able to get close to anyone in an LC, you are more than welcomed to leave. Something I didn\u2019t like when I was an LC in particular was they picked horrible schedules for me (8am classes all freshmen year) but I really enjoyed the people within my LC, and I\u2019m still close to them after 3 years. Heck, one of the guys in the LC helped me get into a research lab and into volunteer opportunities off campus. I would suggest try to get close or study with your LC if you can, see how this quarter turns out and then decide winter quarter if you want to stay or not like the other redditor said",

Every person who wins a suit against a police officer has it thrown out on appeals, this is why people sue the department or cities since they dont get qualified immunity. Qualified immunity allows a police officer to fire his gun into a locked front yard at a dog at a party full of children \"For no reason\" according to the supreme court, who also said but qualified immunity protects him because \"Firing your gun into a crowd of children for no reason was not previously found to be a violation of rights\" They then proceeded to not make that case a violation, meaning it can happen again.

I dont know the complete details but i just know that the ex gf and the dude bestie were very close and hung out one on one like a lot and eventually they hooked up. Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol. \n\nBut ya, i mean i would love to hear your guys thoughts cuz i def think a lot of ppl here and in general are completely fine with platonic friends which i agree, but like when youre dating, i personally would start to hope she would spend more time with me than them cuz well im her bf right?

Are we studying for hours in tbe library? Probably fine. Am I going over to her dorm and getting drunk alone with her? Not fine. Rule of thumb: don't get into intimate or potentially intimate situations (one on one in a private setting with lots of locked doors and convenient beds) with someone other than your partner.\n\n\nI feel like a lot of this is common sense.",

And the academic advisors are not the best nor most helping. That being said there are some things that only an academic advisor can help you with (holds, academic probation etc etc.) but when it comes to registering for classes they are not the most knowledgeable!   \n  \nThats where I come in!!! I am a senior now and thought I would try and help relieve some of the registration stress  that I had when I first started college!! Not B.S. Just trying to help people out before I graduate!!!

I just transferred to UCR from the Bay as a 3rd-year, and I was *so* excited to get started \u2014 but honestly, it\u2019s been tough facing what feels like transfer judgment.\n\nI\u2019m a really outgoing person, and I\u2019ve been putting myself out there these past few weeks, going to a lot of recruitment events for both professional frats and clubs. But it\u2019s been discouraging getting dropped just because I\u2019m a 3rd-year transfer \u2014 like, that\u2019s not something I can control. It sucks feeling like I\u2019m being judged for my year instead of what I can actually bring to the table.\n\nI know I only have two years here, so I\u2019ve been trying to make the most of it, but it\u2019s hard when it feels like people overlook you for freshmen who have \u201cmore time.\u201d Honestly, my community college felt more welcoming than this \u2014 it\u2019s been a real culture shock.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m still going to keep putting myself out there because I don\u2019t want to give up, but I can\u2019t help feeling a little discouraged. Has anyone else gone through this? I swear I\u2019m friendly and really don\u2019t like just staying in bed doing nothing \u2014 I just want to find my people here.\n\nPS: I have never faced rejection so its harder TT",

Where you see literally the same type of people who commits those crimes.\n\nIsn't it the right who 16 crude pipe bombs to high profile figures like Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama in October 2018? \n\nWe also have right wing militia group plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer around October 2020 where they were planning to kidnap her from her vacation home just because of her Covid-19 policies.\n\nThen we have a David Depart who broke into Nancy Pelosi home and bludgeoned her husband intending to hold her hostage. He was influenced by right-wing conspiracies like Gamergate. \n\nWe also have the burning of Judge Diane Goodstein's home where a fire was started at her South Carolina home. The Judge ruled against Trump administration policies.\n\nStudies have shown that MAGA Republicans are more likely to incite more violence than the left.\n\nI like how you mention Jesus because didn't he say, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" - Matthew 22:39? Because well loving God is first and loving your neighbor as yourself? \n\nBecause God literally created us as equals and he loves us in our own way. As shown with John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life,\" because he sacrificed his own son to save the world and it implies that Jesus has love to all of humanity and we need to take that to heart. Because he did not just love you. He LOVED everyone.\n\nWe also see this in Matthew 25:35-40, \"For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me... Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.\" Where the whole concept of this is caring for strangers which is often interpreted as people of different backgrounds like immigrants is equivalent as caring for him. Implying that his love is for everyone. Not just you or me.\n\nSo tell me, where in the Bible that uphold what MAGA did that I mentioned earlier? To me it is not those of what Jesus has taught us.",

Just to make it easier for me to understand, since you mentioned all of those points. But provided little to no evidence other than your own statements and belief in supporting someone who will not support you back. Unlike what I did. Then let me try to find evidence to see if you are right? \n\n1. Charlie Kirk Death: \n\nCharlie was never killed by a Democrat. In fact, he was killed by a person named Tyler Robinson, aged 22 years old, who had a republican upbringing. He was never affiliated with the Democratic Party in any way. In fact in his Utah Voter records show him as unaffiliated and inactive. In fact, the killing was condemned by the Democrats. With Obama and Kamala sharing their condolences to Charlie's family on X. Something that Republicans wish to always ignore.\n\n2. \"Democrats Support transgender giving them drugs that mess up their brains and bodies\"\n\nThis is misleading and inaccurate. Democrats do give access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth, which does include puberty blockers and hormone therapy. However, it is checked and reviewed by the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These treatments are reversible for the blocks and are partially reversible for hormones, which are prescribed after evaluation with a professional doctor. Study also shows that it improves mental health, reduces depression, anxiety, which are often comparable to cisgender people of the same age. It just seems that you ignore that evidence, and it just comes from pure hatred of the Democratic Party. \n\n3. \"Democrats Support men in women's sports\"\n\nYeah, this is partially true, but you kinda oversimplify. Democrats have opposed outright bans on transgender athletes in sports. The Biden administration wanted to ask for rules for having restrictions on transgender athletes, keeping it fair in any sport. However, it is not killing anyone, so I do not know why you give it any energy. Plus, most of the international sports that people watch are not regulated by the U.S. government but their own organization, like FIFA with Soccer.\n\n4. \"Democrats Support illegals, sex traffickers, murderers\"\n\nThis is false, just straight up false. Democrats want humane immigration policies. This includes a better way for undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship to reunite them with their families. They have backed border security, for instance, with Biden's 2024 executive action reducing illegal crossings. The only thing they disagree about is mass deportations. There are no sources of any Democratic policy that have endorsed sex traffickers or murderers, and both parties are in agreement with cracking down on crime. \n\n5. \"Democrats Support murdering unborn babies (60 million) more than all wars total\"\n\nYou are almost accurate with the numbers. Roe v. Wade gives us an estimate of 63 million abortions in America. So you are accurate about that. However, Democrats do not support murdering babies. They support abortion rights as healthcare, and democrats advocate for restoring this access and view it as violating bodily autonomy. The label about murder is more of a moral stance and not a factual one. While the U.S is right now pumping money to Israel for it's genocide killing babies and children, also while they are doing that cutting benefits for under privelege kids and people. Very \"pro-life\" indeed. Also in the bible, Mary gave HER consent to have his CHILD. Which is something that a lot of rapists do not do. \n\n6. \"Democrats kill Christians\"\n\nI genuinely could not find any sources on that, as there are literally none. There is more violence against Democrats, like the 2025 shootings of Minnesota legislators, or when we have Christian extremism targeting others. It is just baseless fearmongering at this point.\n\n\n7. \"Democrats let protesters into the capital, capital police killed a unarmed woman\"\n\nFalse? This is so false, I can't believe you actually believe this? The Trump Supporters literally breached the barriers, and the police force was overwhelmed. Ashli Babbitt was unarmed and was shot by Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd while trying to climb through a broken door towards the speaker's lobby, where all of the lawmakers were sheltered. Democrats condemned the riot while Trump wanted the rioters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\n8. \"Democrats tried to kill trump twice\"\n\nFalse, really, we have Thomas Matthew Crooks, who is a registered Republican who attempted to kill him in July 2024. Then we have Ryan Wesley, who is an independent voter who has no association with any parties. Both were lone actors.\n\n9. \"Democrats are trying to kill police\"\n\nThis is False, as there is no evidence to suggest this. Most democratic policies are just cutting police budgets. However, they refunded or increased the funding when crime rises. Biden's American Rescue Plan also provided $350 million for police hiring. Democrats aren't assaulting police officers. Assaults on officers only grew because of issues outside of politics.\n\n10. \"Democrat states have The highest crime rates\"\n\nThis is very misleading, as crime rates have to do with urban density, poverty, and guns. Not politics. Cities like Memphis, which has a republican mayor, or St. Louis, which is Democratic, are high in crime. A lot of Democratic cities are not soft on crime. \n\n11. \"90% of republicans are Christians.\" \n\nThis is false, there was a study done by the Public Religion Research Institute did a poll where it is actually, \"the Republican party, the largest group is white Christians (68%), including 29% who are white evangelical Protestants, 19% who are white mainline Protestants, and 17% who are white Catholics, compared with 16% who identify as Christians of color. The remainder of Republicans (16%) identify as religiously unaffiliated (12%) or as Jewish (2%), Hindu (1%), or belong to other non-Christian religions (1%).\"\n\nYour last statement of needing to read the bible more. Yeah, everyone does? I do not hate people for who they are. Or associate people just because of who they vote for. I do not hate anyone, nor do I intend to imply that I am trying to hate you. However, I have seen Republicans using the bible to justify their hatred. Which is something that I do not like. You seem to care more about feelings than facts. When you are supposed to think critically rather than being fed by MAGA and their propaganda. It is to the point where MAGA are worshipping Trump like he is Jesus, and that is blasphemy. \n\nPlease do more research in the bible and actually critically think rather than absorb Media like a black hole.",

My point is also literally based off of what happened last year, where protest footage was used to paint protesters as violent and unreasonable, and bolstered support for trump for many demographics outside of California. It didn\u2019t even bring about meaningful change, in fact u can argue that things got worse and that these behaviors convinced the White House to bring the military into DC. I think protesting is a great idea, but if u don\u2019t think critically about who you\u2019re yelling at and are just yelling at everybody, you make it very easy to make your entire cause to look bad.

I\u2019m currently a 3rd year here at UCR and as much as I love this school, I unfortunately haven\u2019t had much of a chance to be social and make friends. I\u2019ve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I\u2019d post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! \n\nHere\u2019s a little about me! \n\nI (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don\u2019t get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it\u2019s one of my favorite past times. I\u2019m also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I\u2019m specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven\u2019t played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I\u2019m starting to watch more horror movies, so I\u2019ll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I\u2019m just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out! \n\nReddit might not be the best place for this typa thing, but it\u2019s worth a shot! Have a good day/night and good luck with midterms coming up everyone! :) ",

I saw that they didn\u2019t do it for 2026 and im very scared about winter 2027. I will finish my requirements fall 26 and want to start at ucr winter 27 and not fall behind since I am a premed major and need a gap year for MCAT as well. Also because I have heard it\u2019s easier to get accepted In the winter compared to fall because more people are applying so it could get competitive. I am either thing to transfer as a biology or neuroscience major. Which one do yall recommend? Is neuroscience really hard? Or is it okay, which one would you recommend for me a premed student?",
