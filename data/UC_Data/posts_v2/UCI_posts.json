Any and all advice would be helpful! \nI’m a second year bio sci student, My current GPA is 3.2 with my major/STEM GPA being a 2.8 (ik yikes),  I’m rethinking of becoming a PA as of recently because I’ve having trouble with my grades, especially in chem. In general chemistry I got Straight C+s while getting a D+ in 1C but retaking in summer. I’m in OChem, Bio, and Calc 5A so I think my gpa is just going to get worse from here :/ \n\nMy midterms scores are just below average, and I don’t think any PA school in CA will take me, due to my GPA. I’ve been job hunting but I’ve been working at Starbucks for almost a year, which isn’t medical related at all. I love biology and I want to make a difference in healthcare, but I’m just feeling incredibly lost and overwhelmed as a first gen student. I’m not sure what to do anymore. "

I know I'm falling into the category of \"failed biology\", though I understand that I genuinely dislike it regardless of my standing. I formally spoke to the Biological Sciences counselors recently, being told not to switch due to primarily doing well. However, upon completing the labs, personal onsite training, and even career exploration, I realized I truly do not like it. \n\nI originally pursued biology to have a chance at working within the Biotech field, a former love and sentiment in which I shared with many. Though now, even though I truly do reside with the use of medical technology within the sciences, I realized I can't see myself spending my time in a laboratory all day. Additionally, everyone around me is insanely smart and extremely competitive. I understand I may not be cut out for the work, especially with he lack of enjoyment I feel towards it. \n\nSorry if I branched out into more of a tangent, but what I attempted to convey is still true. My love for this major is somewhat dwindling, and the load for something I am hesitant and directionless towards doesn't seem worth it for me. I've been somewhat degraded and looked down upon by my friends, taking the major, seeing it as weakness/laziness. Weakness it may be, but I don't love it nor see myself doing well onward. \n\nAny advice from any upperclassmen who switched? Any suggestions on what to switch into, considering the completed courses (lower division chemistry and the biology series)? For anyone who switched, what helped you realize? If you didn't switch but took some time completing the degree, please tell me! I want to hear genuine stories, even if I understand it may provide a reality check for me."

No couples and no children. There are 3 rooms available- $1150 (small) and $1300 (large) with a shared bathroom. And $1700 with a private bathroom. The rooms are unfurnished. Utilities will be split equally. I want either the $1300 room or $1150 room. My dad will be my co-signer and we’ll all get your own separate lease.\n\nI’m down to be friends but I will also respect your boundaries if you don’t want to. The most important thing is that we get along. I’d like us to meet up before moving in. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Idc what you do but smoking isn’t allowed in any part of the house (landlady’s rules). Id prefer to live with no tobacco smokers. I am strict on no vaping inside the house. Pets aren’t allowed either. \n\nWhat I look for in roommates:\n\n- LGBT friendly \n- cleans up after themselves\n- Will do assigned common area chores each week (we’ll switch it up). I want us all to be considerate about the chores and communicate respectfully (no micromanaging) \n- If you’re sharing a bathroom with me, I’d like us to alternate weeks for cleaning it. \n- Doesn’t smoke or vape inside \n- Is quiet if their roommates need to sleep during reasonable hours\n- Is ok with having people over (including overnight guests) sometimes but doesn’t have people over all the time. I don’t want the house to be constantly filled with people or for your partner to be here constantly as if they are living there\n- Communicates well and respectfully\n- Recognizes that we are all equals. We all want to be fair and no one matters more than anyone else. \n- Is ok with me talking on the phone. I’m not an unreasonably loud person but I like to talk on the phone a lot. \n- Idc if you sleep in but if someone is up and making noise at reasonable hours and it wakes you up, wear headphones or earplugs. \n- Is ok with the AC used during the hotter times and the heat being used if it’s cold.\n- Will actually use the dishwasher as a dishwasher and not use it as a drying rack. I will buy a drying rack if you want to hand wash all your dishes. \n- Is ok with sharing cookware (totally get it if you have allergies or celiac but other than that, let’s maximize space in the kitchen) \n- Is ok with having a general rule of no doing laundry past a certain hour depending on when everyone goes to sleep.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you’re interested!"

I also want to graduate in 3 years, and it just seems that it may get hectic trying to complete honors at the same time. I already have lower division writing credit from AP Lang and Lit, and most of my other GEs are fulfilled through other transfer credit so dropping HumCore cannot hurt my progress. I should note I technically have sophomore status bc of all the transfer credits I have through AP or Dual Credit so my class registration shouldn't be that bad right? I'm working on switching my degree to Ed Sci with a history minor.\n\nEssentially, my main question here is how should I withdraw? Can I still register for winter classes with CHC priority and just drop it once winter quarter hits so my classes don't get dropped? Also, will I get kicked out of honors housing (my main concern, though I don't think they would do this. Also, housing guarentee ik I would lose but I plan to get an ACC apartment next year anyways).

        "body": "Para”s bmx world of BMX racing has always been about pushing boundaries, and empowering para Racing Australia casting  incredible athletic talent. However, one crucial step toward inclusivity remains unfulfilled – the inclusion of para BMX categories in the prestigious UCI World Championships 2026.  Para BMX athletes have demonstrated unmatched dedication and prowess in the sport, breaking stereotypes and achieving remarkable feats. Despite facing unique challenges, they train tirelessly, embodying the spirit of BMX racing. Recognizing their efforts and providing a global platform to compete would not only be a significant victory for these athletes but also a step forward for the world of sports in acknowledging and celebrating diversity \n\nWe urge the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) to take this vital step and include para BMX categories in the 2026 World Championships. It is not just a matter of competition, but a matter of equality, representation, and the future of the sport. Please join us in advocating for a brighter, more inclusive future for BMX racing by signing this petition and supporting para BMX athletes in their rightful place on the world stage."

This would've been very, very different without a helmet or at higher speeds.

I honestly didn’t look into much of the engineering clubs at the beginning of the school year and now I regret it bc I know some of the applications may have closed by now since it’s already week 4 but am interested in any opportunities or projects open right now or are accepting applications for winter or spring quarter so that I can build up my resume. I feel really behind because I see so many people with jacked resumes and lots of experience and I have nothing so please let me know"

I’m in a very small major so I already know everyone in my classes (basically everyone is taken), and I don’t really know how to expand outside of that.\n\nI’m looking for ways that I can meet new people because I want to try sleeping around in my last year. I’ve been in long-term relationships before (so I’m not inexperienced lmao) and I have been told (both by my gfs and other girls) that I look good and have a funny and kind personality.\n\nI’m just not sure how to start. School clubs always felt weird because people focus mostly on their work rather than socializing (which is fine, you went to a club to do that lmao) and I don’t really feel that’s the right environment.\n\nI could uber to some of the college bars, but they’re probably gonna be too loud for me and I don’t feel comfortable approaching random women because that feels kinda weird and objectifying. They’re minding their own business and dancing, why am I interrupting? I’ve been told that I don’t set off the creep alarm so that’s something ig but it still feels weird. I’m very inexperienced when it comes to bar culture and would like some help.\n\nI’m not sure where else to look, honestly. I heard that UCI is a dead school when I first came here and I didn’t really care at the time but now I’m missing it. I want to try short term relationships and sleeping around to see if I like it but just have no idea where to start.\n\nI’m sorry if any of this comes off as pretentious/performative. I legitimately try to be myself and don’t lie or change my personality in an attempt to fit in more. Just looking for some advice :&gt;"

OFAS said it usually takes 24 hours to disburse the money to pay for the fees so it would be by tmr which is obviously past the deadline. My fall quarter registration fees were paid tho, and the balance I have on zotaccount is just from adjustments to the grants. \nBasically what I’m asking is, can I just wait for the disbursement from the financial aid? Or will I be dropped from my classes? \nThe OFAS worker I was speaking to said they weren’t entirely sure, but that if I hadn’t received an email warning me of being dropped unless the fees were paid, that I likely wouldn’t be dropped, but again, wasn’t completely sure. \n\nIf anyone could help or give me an answer i would really appreciate it, thank you🙏"

Many of us joined not knowing anyone, and Kesem quickly became a place where we could feel at home.\n\nYou don’t need any experience, and you don’t need to know anyone coming in. We're open to all students. If you’re looking for friends, a way to get involved, or just a group of people who care, you’re always welcome here.\n\nOur meetings are **Every Wednesday from 6-7 pm in Steinhaus Hall 174**, and you’re welcome to just show up. Or if you’d prefer, feel free to message me whether you want to hear more about Kesem or you just want someone to reach out to and talk with at UCI.\n\n:)"

They have rules, too, and need to keep passengers and even you, my dear delinquent skateboarder, safe. \nWhether you thought it was cool or not, that was an incredibly reckless thing to do, and it's not the spirit anteaters need to have toward our school and fellow students. \nPlease stay safe and make better decisions. \nYou need not hitch a ride with a bus if your skateboarding is too slow; you can just get on the bus and enjoy the free transport like everyone else\n"

I also tried different ways, uploading from computer and iPad directly but no luck. Thank you!! \n"

I don’t have many friends bc of personal reasons and also cutting them out of my life for several years and as always, everyone forgets my birthday and when they do tell me hbd, it’s always days earlier or after my birthday and I kinda got used to no one telling me happy birthday. I’m huge on birthdays but it seems when it comes to my friend’s birthday and I go all out, I never get the same response as I want to. And I know what you may be thinking “ oh they’re bad friends you should cut them out” and it’s not necessarily that I think, I don’t think they’re bad friends bc they have been there when I needed them on my hard days but when it comes to my one day where it’s all about me, it’s like the world goes quiet and forgets about. I went to celebrate my birthday early at a theme park a few days ago to celebrate my birthday early which was fun and it felt better than today, well duh bc it was a theme park and it was fun but that day felt more like a birthday than today. My parents are getting up there in age and my dad kinda forgot my birthday when I woke up. We kinda have this tradition where they hang up balloons and stuff but this year he didn’t and instead focused on cleaning stuff and as I was leaving to get cfa to make me feel better he’s like “it’s ur birthday today huh” and it just makes me feel lonely and invisible. Not even my own dad who calls me his best friend remembers my birthday. I work at a school and my MT gave me a balloon and some money which is more than my parents and idk, it seems like people who have more money n care abt me, acknowledge me more. \n\nI live in oc but in the poor areas and I know my parents are trying their best even with financial struggles but we have always made it so our birthdays are the best but today when i am entering my 20’s, it doesn’t feel like I wanna be alive anymore. I don’t wanna kms bc I don’t but I just want all this pain to go away. \n\nI just wish one day I can get to what I wanna be career wise and earn money and live far away from the neighborhood and city I currently live in. Living here makes me remember that if I keep living there, I just won’t amount to anything bc all the people that live there, are people that dropout and have fucked up their lives.\n\nI just wished that when my birthday came and I turned 20, my life would start all over and people would care for me but I guess I can only dream and hope that wish comes true one day and I can be what I wanna be when I grow up and graduate from here. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been crying for the past 3 hours just bc I don’t like how everyone around me has a better life than me and have people who care about them very much and tell them hbd and shit. Everything I own rn, I have bought w my hardworking money bc ik my parents can’t afford helping me anymore even tho they say they’ll help me with anything. \n\nI went through a really hard depression era back in HS and even though I have gotten better , I still have moment where I shut down or just become quiet and stuff and rn , I just feel nothing. I feel numb and sad and depressed and feel nothing. On a day where it’s suppose to be about me, I feel lonely inside and just wanna curl up hide and become invisible. \n\nI kinda went on a tangent and was all over the place, but if you made it this far, thanks for reading.\n\n\n"

I reside in the DC Metropolitan area, and I don't see any other universities I would want to attend that aren't in California. I want to study and eventually live long-term as I see more opportunities for myself there, both academically and professionally.\n\nMy original plan was to graduate early, move to Los Angeles to live with my older sibling, and enroll immediately in a community college. However, after extensive research, I’ve found that proving financial independence for in-state tuition would be nearly impossible, as I would be unemployed and relying on an out-of-state 529 plan to pay for community college and later transfer to UCI. Besides financial independence, I meet every other residency requirement, such as physical presence, intent, and immigration status.\n\nTo strengthen my residency case, I’ve considered registering to vote in California, obtaining a driver’s license, and registering my car there. Doing all this, though, still doesn't fix the dependency issue, so I created a new plan. I’m considering taking a gap year after graduating early to work part-time and support myself by covering rent, food, and transportation. This could help me establish genuine financial independence before enrolling in a California community college. Could this plan make me eligible for in-state tuition?\n\nPlease let me know, thanks.\n\n  \n"

Nothing extensive, I won’t ask for your student ID number or financial aid letter or anything of a sensitive nature like that. Probably just like a CANVAS screenshot and a job offer letter (with some job info redacted is totally acceptable).\n\nI’ve met some colleagues on here so I thought it was worth a shot to seek anyone on here that would like for some of their story to be told (:\n\nOkay, thanks for considering, please do send me a private message (DM) if you are interested. In any case, good luck or resonating blessings this year!\n\n¡Chao!\n"

I felt like every attempt of making friends for a whole year ended in superficial relationships or small talk that never really meant anything, but I kept trying (because dropping out wasn’t really an option) and eventually I found a group of really solid people I spend all my time with!\n\nFor anyone feeling like they’re having a hard time making friends or stressing over finals, keep on trying!! You only ever fail if you give up, and theres nothing to lose from an awkward conversation or even a rejection. Be bold, have conversations, go complement someone’s outfit, ask if you can sit with someone outside (too many tables are being used for a single person).
