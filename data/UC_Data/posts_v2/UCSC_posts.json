        "body": "Hey, everyone! UCSC mom here. Need your help locating my daughter‚Äôs stolen e-bike (Actbest). It was stolen from Rachel Carson the night of October 15th. Allegedly there were several bikes stolen that night. \n\nShe saw someone riding the same exact bike on Monday (Oct. 20) and today while she was waiting for the bus. (I‚Äôve attached a picture and video.) I don‚Äôt want to wrongfully accuse anyone but just want to figure out if this is her bike or not as it‚Äôs the exact same one as hers. And, it isn‚Äôt that common of a brand.\n\nShe REALLY needs her bike back as she is having trouble walking uphills due to a recent ACL reconstruction surgery.  My bad for not putting a tracking device on it and her bad for not removing the battery that night; which she normally does every night. \n\nThe e-bikes that are for rent there suck btw. She said each time since then that she‚Äôs tried to rent one, the battery wasn‚Äôt charged at all. \n\nPlease help. (FYI report already filed with campus PD). "

The prompt is \"hygge\", a danish word roughly translating to togetherness and coziness. \n\nI have published one edition so far which you can view either through a link from my instagram bio [linked here](https://www.instagram.com/kittycatclawmachine/) or if you message me I can try to get you a physical copy! I also have more information about the zine on instagram and am happy to answer any other questions here :) \n\nWhether you're a writer, artist, or just someone who has 5 minutes to spare and a creative spirit, I would be so appreciative if you submit something! üêà"

This shows that the sheriffs department would may not take the necessary steps to protect you in a similar situation. \n\nUpdate 11AM: the DA and Santa Cruz county sheriff have officially stated that they will not pursue said report or case meaning that if you fit my demographic and live with your landlord, indecent exposure in the home will not be pursued let alone investigated!

The person was on Empire Grade, a scenic, windy road that leads into the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains and is a well-known spot for strenuous bike rides. Cal Fire did not disclose if the person was hiking or biking up the road. \n\nIt‚Äôs also unknown if the rescue was called in by the person who fell or by a bystander. When crews from Cal Fire, the Santa Cruz Fire Department, Santa Cruz Police Department and California State Parks eventually found the person, they were injured, Juliette said.\n\nRescuers used a rope rescue system and hoisted the person out of the terrain with a stokes basket, Juliette said. (A stokes basket is a stretcher made of metal wire or plastic and designed to keep the rescuee stable.) A photo from the Cal Fire Facebook page shows the rescuers from various agencies carrying the basket through rugged terrain.\n\nA CALSTAR helicopter, which is a medical air service, was able to land next to the rescue and help ‚Äúcut out ground transportation time,‚Äù Cal Fire said in its social media post. The person was subsequently transported to a local hospital for their injury, Juliette added.\n\nOctober 20, 2025\n\n"

        "body": "Seattle-based Amazon said the problems were centered in its Virginia-based US-EAST-1 data center region, one of its most important cloud hubs around the world. The region is a backbone \"for so many services that when things go screwy, domino effects around the internet-as-we-know-it are enormous,\" wrote John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity researcher at Citizen Lab, in a social media post.\n\nAWS traced the source of the problem to something called the \"DynamoDB endpoint in the US-East-1 Region,\" in a pair of jargon-laden updates.\n\n\"DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know, but it underpins the apps and services that all of us use every single day,\" said cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple.\n\nDynamoDB is a centralized database service that many internet-based services use to track user information, store key data and manage their operations, Chapple said by email.\n\nIt's \"one of the record-keepers of the modern internet,\" said Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. \"It's fast, it's cheap, and it's reliable. But today it stopped working and we saw the effects of that outage ripple across the internet.\"\n\n\"Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data. It's as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia,\" Chapple said.\n\nAmazon has attributed the outage to a domain name system issue. DNS is the service that translates internet addresses into machine-readable IP addresses that connects browsers and apps with websites and underlying web services. DNS errors disrupt the translation process, interrupting the connection.\n\nBecause so many sites and services use AWS, a DNS error can have widespread results."

I have been working to the best of my ability in this course, I have been submitting everything on time- and it‚Äôs frustrating that I can‚Äôt hear any feedback on what I‚Äôm doing, and as it stands now, I am essentially failing this class, despite me doing literally nothing wrong.\n\nPlease help!

Self-correction mechanisms in LLMs - worked on getting models to actually fix their own errors\n2. Malicious APK detection using ML - Android malware classification\n3. IoT anomaly detection - security stuff for IoT devices\n\n**Projects:**\n\n* Built Lokus - a full knowledge management app with OAuth 2.0, Gmail integration, cross-platform (Windows/Mac), 68 AI tools built into an MCP server. Like I literally implemented the entire auth system from scratch with PKCE and everything\n* HackHarvard 2025 - competed against MIT/Stanford/CMU kids. Built IRIS, an iOS app using LiDAR + AI pathfinding for blind navigation with haptic feedback. Judges from big companies actually wanted to connect after\n* Some app I made has 10k+ users (can't say which for privacy but it's live and people actually use it)\n\n**Other stuff:**\n\n* President of CS club, took 8 students to HackHarvard\n* Actually know how to code - React, Rust, Swift, Python, Java, not just leetcode grinding\n* Working on reinforcement learning stuff, implemented PPO algorithms\n\n**The Reality Check:**¬†If I get 3.7-3.8 next two semesters, I'll end up around 3.4 GPA by transfer apps. Still mid but better than 2.94.\n\n**My actual question:**¬†Do schools like UIUC or Berkeley even look at people like me? Like yeah my GPA is trash but I'm literally doing the research and building the systems they teach. I'm not just some kid with good grades who's never built anything real.\n\nOr should I be realistic and focus on:\n\n* Arizona State (they have insane AI programs, #1 in innovation)\n* Purdue (new AI major, solid CS)\n* Northeastern (co-op program, good for someone who learns by doing)\n* UC San Diego (new AI undergrad major)\n\n**I guess my real question is:**¬†Do top CS programs care more about GPA or actual demonstrated ability? Because I can show them 3 research projects, multiple complex systems I've built from scratch, and competition experience... but that 2.94 is gonna be on the transcript forever.\n\nAm I wasting my time applying to reaches or do I actually have a shot with this profile?\n\nAlso if anyone's transferred into a top CS program with a similar situation PLEASE let me know how tf you did it.\n\nUpvote2Downvote3Go to comments  \n"

I want to be as qualified as possible and get the most opportunities after college but I don‚Äôt want to exhaust myself and start hating psychology or ruin my mental health. Any advice? "

I can tag there with my current GPA, but I am staying two more years at CC to do major prep and improve my grades, as well as get more involved via starting a club and engaging more with my honors society, tutoring, etc. I‚Äôve visited UCSC and I loved the campus. \n\nThere are only two issues for me, housing and the fact that there is no formal Comparative Literature major. If anyone is a lit major, pls comment because that‚Äôs kinda the only thing that holds me back and makes me still hold out hope for Berkeley and UCLA, and consider UCI. (Davis is way too hot.)\n\nHow do you guys fare with the housing, and how many people end up homeless? (I am dead serious about this question.) I am low income to be fully transparent, but I expect to take out loans and also save my pell grant distributions these last two years at CC to put towards uni.\n\nThanks so much! Hopefully I end up a plato-reading banana slug! ü§ì"

I am considering this as my top choice, maybe along with UCB and UCLA but i dont think i will get in. I have a GPA of 4.5 w and 3.8 uw, and I have some good research and research paper ec's, 2 sports from school, 2 internships in compsci, an internship from nasa, s2 summer programs, multiple passion projects related to coding, volunteer with the city of oakland, volunteered in a hospital and tutored underprivileged children, and i also have a job.

Every lecture makes me even more of a Dhar apologist than I actually am to the point I feel relief and joy entering his 8am because of how rancid my tummy feels at 9:20 when Aris makes the entire class sit through 65 minutes of disjointed rambling that fails to teach the core methods necessary for the assigned work.\n\nIs there some way to get the Physics department to audit our class? I hear he got banned from teaching Upper-Divs, and I honestly think he deserved it from how he's performed so far. Good grief. Obviously, I'll lock in and use the textbook to supplememt my learning, I'm not going to fail (despite taking 21 units), but dear lord I hope there's something we can do. I don't want to waste an entire quarter year on this class with Aris teaching it like he is.\n\nIf there's a way to have the Physics department make him get his shit together, or start using some pre-written curriculum, or replaced with someone else, or literally anything, that would be life-changing.\n\nThank you for listening to my rant."

I am already planning on taking summer classes. After I graduate I would like to have a job that deals in product management(product manager).

The intent is to keep up with the residents and identify those who are in need of help or campus resources. You may hear about this under the names \"Intentional Interactions\" or \"One-on-one meetings\". These conversations can be logged in a google sheet that can be accessed by Student Housing staff. **Unfortunately, many RAs fail to disclose the fact that conversations with them are not private/confidential, let alone stored on the cloud.** Some students may want to befriend their RA and chat about sensitive information such as relationships, academics, or substance abuse. This information could very easily end up in the hands of housing supervisors or the conduct office. Even if you did nothing wrong, any misunderstanding from the housing staff (don't expect much from them) could lead to very real consequences involving your housing contract, student employment, or enrollment status. Obviously, the chance of this happening is 1%, but the impact said disaster is too great to ignore.\n\n  \nIf you get messages from RAs claiming you are required to speak with them, you have the option to politely decline, per the 5th Amendment. \n\n  \nTitle is obviously dramatized (see on youtube \"Don't Talk to the Police\"). I may sound a little crazy, but I speak from personal experience.  During my first year on campus, I only found out 6 months into living in the dorm that my RA had logged a good amount of our conversations and sent them to their CRE. Although there were no consequences, I felt violated by the lack of privacy and transparency in this process. \n\nWhen I left in 2024, it seemed like the Housing staff did not particularly care about this issue. Hopefully things are changing."

Thankfully the advisor was nice and told me to come in if the money hadn't arrived. Had to wait in line for over an hour just to get halfway. \n\nAll this to say, I wanted to ask, should I worry about the housing and dining fees too much? Does anyone else have this issue?

(I haven't done quarter system)\n* What challenges should a transfer student expect in the psych program?\n* Are there opportunities for research or internships as an undergrad?\n* How approachable are the faculty and advisors?\n* Any tips for succeeding or standing out in the program?\n* Rec. courses, maybe particularly useful for cognitive or developmental psych?\n* What resources (clubs, tutoring, workshops) help students succeed in psychology?\n* Overall experience at UCSC (pros/cons)"

Maybe worth the stress or maybe not. \n\nThe worst case is you get there and it's all full and you have to go to 3 different stations to find one with space, you go over your allocated time budget and get charged overage fees and then end up walking to class which would have been faster if you took the bus or walked directly depending on the trip. Ask me how I know that. \n\nIt's just not worth it unless you can be certain there is lots of space shown in the app, don't have anything time sensitive, or you are going off campus as the parking isn't as big of a problem when going off campus.

They are from Acts2 which used to be called Gracepoint, which used to be called Berkland. It's a high control group and once you get sucked in, they will end up controlling most of your life.\n\nThey will lure you with free food and instant friends. They have a \"Frosh Social and Night Market\" today. Please don't go. Or if you do go, don't give them your phone number or email address. Don't tell them where you live.\n\nBe warned and do not join this group. For the first year, they will make it seem like it's all just fun and they just want to get to know you. They use love bombing to lure you to their group and then as the years pass, they will want you to spend most of your time, if not all, with this group and this group only.\n\nChristianity Today published [an article](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/09/gracepoint-berkland-asian-american-church-discipleship/) about this group and as a former member, I can confidently say that everything they wrote is true.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM KLESIS and any other Acts 2 associated group."

It went to downtown and stopped there, leaving me stuck. Thought a guide would be helpful\n\n### PRE-NOTE: I have the \"ucsc bus theorem\". It's pretty simple.\n\nIf the distance is less than 2 stops, if a bus isn't visible when you get to a bus stop JUST WALK üôè. 95% of the time you will get there faster than the bus. For example JRL -&gt; Kresge, or Quarry -&gt; Crown.\n\n## LOOP BUS\n\nLoop buses are box-shaped and **NEVER** articulated buses (the slinky ones). They say \"loop\" clearly on the top display sign.\n\nLoop buses **do not run during the day on weekends!** Plan for this.  \n\\- Regular service is available 7:30am -&gt; 5:30pm.\n\nSometimes buses will say \"upper campus\". This means they basically just go back and forth from Oakes -&gt; main entrance.\n\nIf you are at Porter/RC and see a upper campus loop bus, it will take a **LONG TIME** to reach the campus entrance because instead of driving down empire grade, it will loop back through campus!\n\n## City Bus: 18, 19, 11, 20\n\nFirst of all, I don't recommend taking the bus to get around downtown Santa Cruz. It's a surprisingly bikeable city. Get the ebike membership (bcycle), ucsc subsidizes it. Anywhere left of the river is less than a 10-minute ride away.\n\nThe 19 buses travel **clockwise** around campus. 18 travels **counterclockwise**.\n\nIMPORTANT: City buses do not necessarily LOOP back around to campus! They have a very long route that goes into the city, usually ends at Trader Joes.\n\nSo, if you are at Kresge and want to go to the gym, do not rely on the 18 to loop around and get you there!\n\nHere is the full bus schedule: https://scmtd.com/en/routes/202610/11/wd\n\n## General Transportation Tips\n\nUnspoken rule, but if your destination is one stop away, just walk! Our campus has a very accessible \"school area\". Most lecture halls and locations are walkable and definitely bike able from each other.\n\nThe walking trails and beautiful routes between classes is one of the things I have enjoyed most about ucsc. It gives you a moment to cool off and think. So try and enjoy that instead of endlessly complaining about the bus schedule... \n\nIf this helped, consider upvoting. "

The bus will say \"Hwy 17 Express to Scotts Valley via Scotts Valley Dr\".\n\nNote that this only occurs on weekdays. All 17 busses go to Santa Cruz on weekends.\n\nTo connect to Santa Cruz on these buses, you will need to transfer to the 35X. (If you do not have a student ID, ask the 17 bus driver for a transfer to Santa Cruz.) While this is supposed to be a \"timed\" transfer, the bus is usually late, so you'll probably have to wait about 10 minutes. **On average, this will add an additional 25 minutes to your trip.**\n\nThis makes all but the 1:20 PM bus irrelevant, as you might as well just hop on the next 17 to Santa Cruz and get there at about the same time.\n\nThis is part of an effort to give more seats to Scotts Valley riders, and they need to get the buses to SV somehow.
