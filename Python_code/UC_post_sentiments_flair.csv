Rethinking Bio Sci/ PA school,"Hi! Any and all advice would be helpful! 
I’m a second year bio sci student, My current GPA is 3.2 with my major/STEM GPA being a 2.8 (ik yikes),  I’m rethinking of becoming a PA as of recently because I’ve having trouble with my grades, especially in chem. In general chemistry I got Straight C+s while getting a D+ in 1C but retaking in summer. I’m in OChem, Bio, and Calc 5A so I think my gpa is just going to get worse from here :/ 

My midterms scores are just below average, and I don’t think any PA school in CA will take me, due to my GPA. I’ve been job hunting but I’ve been working at Starbucks for almost a year, which isn’t medical related at all. I love biology and I want to make a difference in healthcare, but I’m just feeling incredibly lost and overwhelmed as a first gen student. I’m not sure what to do anymore. ",uci,-0.43,Academics

ochem midterm,"I just got back my midterm score for vanderwal 51A and did not do well. The class avg (71%) was surprisingly high from what I have read about his previous classes. I missed small points on like the curve arrows because I drew them the wrong way. I tried to look at the answer key but I still don't completely understand what way the arrows go. Does the organic chemistry tutor or a different youtube channel help with topics like these? I also got the resonance structures wrong, but I'm not sure why.

A bit of yap.

High school was so much easier imo and I took AP classes. My GPA is a 3.7 right now, but I've already had to retake chem 1C over the summer.

Switching Out of BioSci,"Hello everyone, I am genuinely looking for some advice or pointers! I know I'm falling into the category of ""failed biology"", though I understand that I genuinely dislike it regardless of my standing. I formally spoke to the Biological Sciences counselors recently, being told not to switch due to primarily doing well. However, upon completing the labs, personal onsite training, and even career exploration, I realized I truly do not like it. 

I originally pursued biology to have a chance at working within the Biotech field, a former love and sentiment in which I shared with many. Though now, even though I truly do reside with the use of medical technology within the sciences, I realized I can't see myself spending my time in a laboratory all day. Additionally, everyone around me is insanely smart and extremely competitive. I understand I may not be cut out for the work, especially with he lack of enjoyment I feel towards it. 

Sorry if I branched out into more of a tangent, but what I attempted to convey is still true. My love for this major is somewhat dwindling, and the load for something I am hesitant and directionless towards doesn't seem worth it for me. I've been somewhat degraded and looked down upon by my friends, taking the major, seeing it as weakness/laziness. Weakness it may be, but I don't love it nor see myself doing well onward. 

Any advice from any upperclassmen who switched? Any suggestions on what to switch into, considering the completed courses (lower division chemistry and the biology series)? For anyone who switched, what helped you realize? If you didn't switch but took some time completing the degree, please tell me! I want to hear genuine stories, even if I understand it may provide a reality check for me.",uci,-0.43,Academics

Looking for roomies to rent a house in South OC!,"Hello!

I’m a 26F, a student at saddleback college, and I work part time. I am planning on moving into a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath house in South OC, 
and I am looking for two other people (preferably women, gay men, or others in the lgbt community) to move in with me. No couples and no children. There are 3 rooms available- $1150 (small) and $1300 (large) with a shared bathroom. And $1700 with a private bathroom. The rooms are unfurnished. Utilities will be split equally. I want either the $1300 room or $1150 room. My dad will be my co-signer and we’ll all get your own separate lease.

I’m down to be friends but I will also respect your boundaries if you don’t want to. The most important thing is that we get along. I’d like us to meet up before moving in. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Idc what you do but smoking isn’t allowed in any part of the house (landlady’s rules). Id prefer to live with no tobacco smokers. I am strict on no vaping inside the house. Pets aren’t allowed either. 

What I look for in roommates:

- LGBT friendly 
- cleans up after themselves
- Will do assigned common area chores each week (we’ll switch it up). I want us all to be considerate about the chores and communicate respectfully (no micromanaging) 
- If you’re sharing a bathroom with me, I’d like us to alternate weeks for cleaning it. 
- Doesn’t smoke or vape inside 
- Is quiet if their roommates need to sleep during reasonable hours
- Is ok with having people over (including overnight guests) sometimes but doesn’t have people over all the time. I don’t want the house to be constantly filled with people or for your partner to be here constantly as if they are living there
- Communicates well and respectfully
- Recognizes that we are all equals. We all want to be fair and no one matters more than anyone else. 
- Is ok with me talking on the phone. I’m not an unreasonably loud person but I like to talk on the phone a lot. 
- Idc if you sleep in but if someone is up and making noise at reasonable hours and it wakes you up, wear headphones or earplugs. 
- Is ok with the AC used during the hotter times and the heat being used if it’s cold.
- Will actually use the dishwasher as a dishwasher and not use it as a drying rack. I will buy a drying rack if you want to hand wash all your dishes. 
- Is ok with sharing cookware (totally get it if you have allergies or celiac but other than that, let’s maximize space in the kitchen) 
- Is ok with having a general rule of no doing laundry past a certain hour depending on when everyone goes to sleep.

shaka 1a grading,"like many others my midterm for chem 1a with professor shaka went horribly. nobody even finished the exam, and he sent out an email letting us know he will not be curving for this class.

i keep hearing contradictory statements about this, where some chem tutors told me this is a lie and he usually does curve at the end of the quarter; some people saying their courses weren't curved at all. at this point my theory is that he does a curve for the more advanced courses, but for chem 1a, 1b, maybe 1c (?) he doesn't curve.

i've also heard he offers extra credit, but from what he's said so far, it's not really extra credit, moreso ""you'll get repeat questions on the next midterm"", which is nice - but it still doesn't ""make up"" for a terrible first exam, if that makes sense. like it doesn't add any extra points for you.

if someone who has taken shaka for the beginning chem series, 1a - 1c, can please let me know if this is true or not, i'd be eternally grateful. i'm at my wits end trying to guess if my grade will be fine or not and i'm so stressed it's insane. i just need to know if he does curve, or does offer \*real\* extra credit. because if not i don't think my grade can recover lol.",uci,-0.55,Academics

Essentially, my main question here is how should I withdraw? Can I still register for winter classes with CHC priority and just drop it once winter quarter hits so my classes don't get dropped?

ECPS parking ticket,"I've been parking inside the East Campus parking structure to go to the ARC since the beginning of the last school year. I've always had a commuter parking pass and everything's been fine, but recently I got a parking ticket because I was apparently parked in a reserved/residents stall. I appealed the claim because that made no sense, but they rejected the appeal because I'm apparently supposed to only park in the white stalls. I'm utterly confused because aren't all the stalls inside the parking structure yellow? Does that mean im only allowed to parking in the outside parking lot? I'm further confused because I've had no issues in the past, so why am I only suddenly getting fined? Can anyone tell me what im missing?",uci,-0.33,Housing

this is stressing me out because i'd like to see exactly how i'm doing, with all the course weights and grades inputted; i don't want to get a bad surprise at the end of the quarter.

 **Please, please, wear helmets, watch your speed, keep your eyes on the road, and stay safe.** I was riding a bicycle down the hill between Middle-earth and Langson, fell over due to braking over a bump where a bollard was taken out. Fortunately, I was wearing a helmet, and I was just coasting rather than actually gunning it. The result is that I walked away with a few scratches and need a new helmet. This would've been very, very different without a helmet or at higher speeds. Also, the number of times I've had near misses from people distracted on scooters (either scrolling or earbuds in) makes me kinda scared to walk rather than bike anywhere on campus.

Did pay by plate parking and now UCI is telling me I owe them more money,"I visited this campus for the first time a week ago and paid for a 24 hour parking pass. In the parking pass email it literally says this:

“Thank you for your UCI parking purchase!
Upon arrival, your license plate serves as your permit, there is no need to print this confirmation.  
For reference, your transaction details are included below:”

Then UCI emails me this:

“After reviewing the information you provided and the details of the citation, we are unable to grant a full dismissal of the citation.

We acknowledge that you were a first time visitor; therefore the citation will be cancelled for a fee of $16.00, the cost of a daily parking permit. As stated on campus and lot entrance signs, a valid permit must be displayed or vehicle registered at all times.”

Maybe they shouldn’t have conflicting information? I literally did what their parking staff told me to do and then they cited me for parking when I paid for 24 hours and now are basically refusing to waive it. Any judge would throw this out in a traffic court room easily.

Not sure how to meet new people,"Hey everyone, using a throwaway because I want to stay anonymous. For info, I’m a straight guy.

It’s my last year here at UCI and it feels like I don’t really know anyone. I’m in a very small major so I already know everyone in my classes (basically everyone is taken), and I don’t really know how to expand outside of that.

I’m looking for ways that I can meet new people because I want to try sleeping around in my last year. I’ve been in long-term relationships before (so I’m not inexperienced lmao) and I have been told (both by my gfs and other girls) that I look good and have a funny and kind personality.

I’m just not sure how to start. School clubs always felt weird because people focus mostly on their work rather than socializing (which is fine, you went to a club to do that lmao) and I don’t really feel that’s the right environment.

I could uber to some of the college bars, but they’re probably gonna be too loud for me and I don’t feel comfortable approaching random women because that feels kinda weird and objectifying. They’re minding their own business and dancing, why am I interrupting? I’ve been told that I don’t set off the creep alarm so that’s something ig but it still feels weird. I’m very inexperienced when it comes to bar culture and would like some help.

I’m not sure where else to look, honestly. I heard that UCI is a dead school when I first came here and I didn’t really care at the time but now I’m missing it. I want to try short term relationships and sleeping around to see if I like it but just have no idea where to start.

I’m sorry if any of this comes off as pretentious/performative. I legitimately try to be myself and don’t lie or change my personality in an attempt to fit in more. Just looking for some advice :&gt;",uci,-0.23,Social

My fall quarter registration fees were paid tho, and the balance I have on zotaccount is just from adjustments to the grants. 
Basically what I’m asking is, can I just wait for the disbursement from the financial aid? Or will I be dropped from my classes? 
The OFAS worker I was speaking to said they weren’t entirely sure, but that if I hadn’t received an email warning me of being dropped unless the fees were paid, that I likely wouldn’t be dropped, but again, wasn’t completely sure.

Meet New People at UCI [Join our club!],"Camp Kesem!!

It can feel overwhelming, and it’s not always easy to find where you fit in or meet the right people. I definitely last year as a freshman.

If you’ve been looking for a space that’s welcoming, supportive, and genuine, I’d like to invite you to check out **Kesem at UCI**.

We’re a student-run club that supports kids whose parents have been impacted by cancer, but along the way we’ve built a close and caring community here on campus. Many of us joined not knowing anyone, and Kesem quickly became a place where we could feel at home.

You don’t need any experience, and you don’t need to know anyone coming in. We're open to all students. If you’re looking for friends, a way to get involved, or just a group of people who care, you’re always welcome here.

Our meetings are **Every Wednesday from 6-7 pm in Steinhaus Hall 174**, and you’re welcome to just show up. Or if you’d prefer, feel free to message me whether you want to hear more about Kesem or you just want someone to reach out to and talk with at UCI.

Rant,"I’m just gonna rant so if you wanna stay, cool if not all good. So today is my birthday and I’m finally entered my 20’s. I enjoy my birthday but also it’s the worst day in the year. I don’t have many friends bc of personal reasons and also cutting them out of my life for several years and as always, everyone forgets my birthday and when they do tell me hbd, it’s always days earlier or after my birthday and I kinda got used to no one telling me happy birthday. I’m huge on birthdays but it seems when it comes to my friend’s birthday and I go all out, I never get the same response as I want to. And I know what you may be thinking “ oh they’re bad friends you should cut them out” and it’s not necessarily that I think, I don’t think they’re bad friends bc they have been there when I needed them on my hard days but when it comes to my one day where it’s all about me, it’s like the world goes quiet and forgets about. I went to celebrate my birthday early at a theme park a few days ago to celebrate my birthday early which was fun and it felt better than today, well duh bc it was a theme park and it was fun but that day felt more like a birthday than today. My parents are getting up there in age and my dad kinda forgot my birthday when I woke up. We kinda have this tradition where they hang up balloons and stuff but this year he didn’t and instead focused on cleaning stuff and as I was leaving to get cfa to make me feel better he’s like “it’s ur birthday today huh” and it just makes me feel lonely and invisible. Not even my own dad who calls me his best friend remembers my birthday. I work at a school and my MT gave me a balloon and some money which is more than my parents and idk, it seems like people who have more money n care abt me, acknowledge me more. 

I live in oc but in the poor areas and I know my parents are trying their best even with financial struggles but we have always made it so our birthdays are the best but today when i am entering my 20’s, it doesn’t feel like I wanna be alive anymore. I don’t wanna kms bc I don’t but I just want all this pain to go away. 

I just wish one day I can get to what I wanna be career wise and earn money and live far away from the neighborhood and city I currently live in. Living here makes me remember that if I keep living there, I just won’t amount to anything bc all the people that live there, are people that dropout and have fucked up their lives.

I just wished that when my birthday came and I turned 20, my life would start all over and people would care for me but I guess I can only dream and hope that wish comes true one day and I can be what I wanna be when I grow up and graduate from here. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been crying for the past 3 hours just bc I don’t like how everyone around me has a better life than me and have people who care about them very much and tell them hbd and shit. Everything I own rn, I have bought w my hardworking money bc ik my parents can’t afford helping me anymore even tho they say they’ll help me with anything. 

I went through a really hard depression era back in HS and even though I have gotten better , I still have moment where I shut down or just become quiet and stuff and rn , I just feel nothing. I feel numb and sad and depressed and feel nothing. On a day where it’s suppose to be about me, I feel lonely inside and just wanna curl up hide and become invisible. 

I kinda went on a tangent and was all over the place, but if you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Tuition Question,"I'm currently a junior in high school, set to graduate a year early in August 2026. I reside in the DC Metropolitan area, and I don't see any other universities I would want to attend that aren't in California. I want to study and eventually live long-term as I see more opportunities for myself there, both academically and professionally.

My original plan was to graduate early, move to Los Angeles to live with my older sibling, and enroll immediately in a community college. However, after extensive research, I’ve found that proving financial independence for in-state tuition would be nearly impossible, as I would be unemployed and relying on an out-of-state 529 plan to pay for community college and later transfer to UCI. Besides financial independence, I meet every other residency requirement, such as physical presence, intent, and immigration status.

To strengthen my residency case, I’ve considered registering to vote in California, obtaining a driver’s license, and registering my car there. Doing all this, though, still doesn't fix the dependency issue, so I created a new plan. I’m considering taking a gap year after graduating early to work part-time and support myself by covering rent, food, and transportation. This could help me establish genuine financial independence before enrolling in a California community college. Could this plan make me eligible for in-state tuition?

Please let me know, thanks.

Maybe a shot in the dark: any current undergraduate on campus student-workers interested in being interviewed for the 2025-2026 Anthology yearbook?,"Greetings everyone,

As you may have been able to gather, I’m interning as a writer for the University Life section of the UCI 2025-2026 Anthology yearbook. I’m currently conducting interviews of current undergraduate students with on campus jobs to be included in the book! 

Requirements: 
• currently enrolled undergraduate at UCI
• working an ON CAMPUS job while attending
• Unfortunately due to the fact that there is extensive coverage in other sections/pages my request is not including:
- ASUCI
- Yearbook
- Brandywine dining hall
- Anteatery dining hall

Additionally, I will probably be asking for some kind of verification that you attend and work on campus (just because there isn’t really a verification system in place on this subreddit). Nothing extensive, I won’t ask for your student ID number or financial aid letter or anything of a sensitive nature like that. Probably just like a CANVAS screenshot and a job offer letter (with some job info redacted is totally acceptable).

I’ve met some colleagues on here so I thought it was worth a shot to seek anyone on here that would like for some of their story to be told (:

Okay, thanks for considering, please do send me a private message (DM) if you are interested. In any case, good luck or resonating blessings this year!

Uci sucks…,"At least that’s what I thought as a freshmen. I’m in my third year now and it does get better. I feel like I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about UCI being socially dead and that it’s hard to date or something and they’re not wrong, but I also feel like that it gets a lot better as time goes on. 

When I was a freshman I felt like I had no one to talk to, and was cooped up in my room studying or working. I felt like every attempt of making friends for a whole year ended in superficial relationships or small talk that never really meant anything, but I kept trying (because dropping out wasn’t really an option) and eventually I found a group of really solid people I spend all my time with!

For anyone feeling like they’re having a hard time making friends or stressing over finals, keep on trying!! You only ever fail if you give up, and theres nothing to lose from an awkward conversation or even a rejection. Be bold, have conversations, go complement someone’s outfit, ask if you can sit with someone outside (too many tables are being used for a single person). Be the living in a socially dead world

Apply to Transfer for Haas or Econ - UCB,"I’m currently at Los Angeles Pierce College planning to apply to UC Berkeley for Fall 2026, but I’m torn between applying to Haas or Economics in L&amp;S.

I’ll likely apply with around a 3.49–3.5 GPA. I know that’s lower than most Haas or Econ transfers, but my GPA dropped because I witnessed a family member’s passing in a motorcycle accident and have spent months dealing with detectives, DAs, and numerous court dates. I believe I have better than average EC's and I am sure my PIQs will be good.

Also that would be my gpa by the time I submit my APPs. Around winter/spring I would finish with a 3.58-3.6 since I finished all major requirements and only have some gen eds left.

Given everything, do you think I should still shoot for Haas or apply for Econ instead. Any insight from people who’ve gone through this process would really help.",berkeley,0.55,Academics
How to Get Accepted to UC Berkeley,"I'm a junior attending high school in the Central Valley. I visited the Berkeley campus my freshman year and absolutely fell in love. Words can't express how badly I want to get into this school and community. My dream would be to do my undergrad for Veterinary school here and join the Cal Band, both things I'm extremely passionate about. I've maintained a GPA of 4.22, currently taking 3 AP classes and taking another 3 next year. Unfortunately, I find myself with 2 B's right now but I'm hoping to at least bring one up before the end of the semester! While I have this heavy passion and ambition to get it, I'm very worried about the extracurricular part of the application process. I'm not very involved with my school, I'm chronically ill and have chronic fatigue it's hard for me to even get through school days a lot of the time. I'm in marching band and jazz band as section leader/ overall band assistant and volunteer at least 1 hour every week to my local animal shelter, I'm also am in CSF but that's about as extensive as my list gets. I will say I do have excellent English skills and am extremely good at essays. I plan on writing mine about my chronic illness and my experience in physical therapy for chronic pain where doctors constantly praised me for being so strong when to me this was just life. I want to talk about how I've never let my pain or fatigue stop me from dreaming or achieving, when I've realized so many others in my position would give up. Berkeley is my dream and I want to do all I can to get in. What do we think? Will they take into consideration my chronic illness since I am disclosing it and maybe be more lenient on my extracurriculars?

Edit: just remembered I also am planning on taking AP Spanish next year as one of my AP classes and hopefully become bilingual ""certified"" by my school, another unique thing to add to my application!",berkeley,0.73,Academics

Reserved seating question - will we be able to enroll?,"Hi, my friend and I are trying to enroll in this Haas speaker series class. He's a first-year Haas major and has priority registration, while I'm not Haas and don't. He tried enrolling in the course (128 current available spots) but then got waitlisted. We checked and saw that there were 130 seats restricted for Haas majors that've been here for 5+ semesters.

  
Since he's a freshman and I'm not even in Haas, does this mean we **won't** be able to get off the waitlist? I've noticed that the restrictions don't lift after adjustment period, which is different from classes in my major. I've also attached two related screenshots.

  
Kinda sucks since this is the first year they've started doing it for this specific class :(

- The current political state and safety of the US is a big concern for me, though I've heard that California is better than other parts of the US. It's difficult to predict what will happen in 2027, but I wonder whether California currently is safe/welcoming to Chinese students and whether violence/crime is a prominent issue?

- Apparently I'll have to search for my own living space. I wonder if finding living space in that area might be difficult, and if it might be very expensive?

Roommate pisses me off,"My roommate is always in our room. At first it was fine because I’m usually out, but there’s days when I want to study in the room, mainly during the evening before bed. The problem is, I literally can’t study. She is so noisy. Even when she isn’t talking, she literally taps on her mousepad 24/7 which makes such bothersome noise and if she isn’t tapping her mousepad on her laptop, she’s typing nosily on her keyboard. It’s so distracting and it drives me crazy. Like I’ve never once seen her not type or tap. 

During midterm season, she’d make so much distracting noise that I literally spend hours on campus just to avoid coming back. Yesterday when it was raining like crazy, I had to haul myself onto campus even though I’d rather just study in my PJs in the comfort of my room.

And she’s always in the room. It’s so weird because we have an apartment. She refuses to eat dinner anywhere other than in our room even if it’s messy food or food that’ll stink up the place. I caught her last week during a super hot day eating Kim chi soup with the windows completely shut and door closed. She was sweating and dying of heat but refused to leave the room even though the room was so hot and filled with her food aroma. 

I’ve never once seen her willingly leave the apartment and if she does, it’s only for an hour or two. It drives me crazy because it occurred to me that she only sees me in the room at night on weekdays. She gets the whole room to herself on weekdays and weekends because I go home on weekends or I’m spending the whole day outside on weekdays and come back after dark. 

To sum it up, she practically lives in that apt alone cause I’m never there. I used to stay at Berkeley on weekends before I realized I couldn’t stand being around her because she was always at our place. It’s annoying because I hate going home and want to stay at Berkeley, but I cannot stand always seeing her in that room. Is it wrong for me to secretly wish that she would spend less time in our room?? I was fine at first before I started realizing that she does everything in that room and refuses to leave it.

One student pulled up the route on their phone, someone else pressed the stop button, and another person moved up front to guide him.

Cal (5-2) vs Virginia Tech (2-5) @4:30 pm on ESPN,"Been working on a short editorial about why Cal students are so academically driven yet so disconnected from our football culture.

As a transfer and lifelong fan, I’ve noticed that while Memorial’s student sections overflowed early this season, most of campus still feels detached. I tried to unpack why that is — and how new leadership under Ron Rivera and Rich Lyons might shift the narrative.

Curious what other students and alumni think: does Berkeley’s academic intensity make it harder for us to buy into school spirit?

Identity Logan Park - DO NOT LIVE HERE!,"bro I’ve been living here for almost 3 years and it fucking sucks. I’ve only stayed here because of my roommate/best friend since it’s in his budget, if not we would’ve been gone after our first year. 

The furniture, management, and overall building is shitty. I’ve been woken up by the fire alarms more than my own alarm. I’ve had to wait months for things to be repaired like my sink. Anytime I mention an issue or complain, management immediately pushes it under the rug. They tell you it’s affordable rent but then charge you like crazy for extra things that you don’t even sign for. Then they say they can’t even remove it. 

The walls are thin and I’ve heard my upstairs neighbor moaning dude. There’s also crackheads that live here and they sell drugs in the building. The employees know and do nothing about it. 

If you’re looking for housing, look elsewhere. You’ll regret living here after the first month.

Girl arrested yesterday near UCB,"Off Addison and Shattuck I saw a female 19-25 Hispanic or East Indian who was handcuffed and held against a police car’s hood with the cops talking to her for 5+ min, embarassing her but idk what she did!

The cop car was swerved against a street, maybe 3-4 feet of the car blocking the side of the street.

If the cops did their job to arrest her, great, but it seemed excessive and just an unnecessary move to have done that with their car, if it was just to shame her. They could have just parked the car and have her handcuffed in the back seat while interrogating her or asking her her questions and reminding her her Miranda rights…

All I heard was her saying Fruitvale which may be where she lived or is going to the next Bart stop; this was next to the Downtown Berkeley bart station.

students smoking/screaming outside my window nightly,"i’m a recent grad from elsewhere that just relocated to the berkeley area and happened to move to the lovely area that is directly next to the Crossroads Dining Hall. The only problem is that every night / afternoon / early hours of the morning, different groups of students use it as their smoke spot. i smoke myself so i don’t really mind that part, but you all are so LOUD. every single group is genuinely screaming whether it’s 6pm or 2am, wednesday or sunday. 

i also just heard a sound outside around 30 minutes ago and looked out my window to a student peeing on the wall under my window. 

honestly just looking to vent and see if there’s anything i can do about this or if yelling out the window and seeming crazy is my only route. am i allowed to put up signs if my apartment is across an alley directly looking at a UC berkeley dining hall, where the stoop is where they sit?

Has anyone been rejected from comprehensive review with As?,"Feeling a little bit stressed and could use some guidance/a realistic opinion.

I'm currently a freshman applied math major, and really want to do comprehensive review to get into CS. I'm very strong academically and am confident I can keep good grades (A-/A/A+ in pre reqs).

I've heard tons of varying stuff about whether GPA or essays matter most, and ultimately it just feels like there's a lot of variance in the admissions process.

I think I want to get into SWE after my undergrad but am worried I won't be able to pick up critical job pre reqs like CS 170 unless I get admitted.

I did have CS experience during high school but did not try to game the system by applying as non CS, I thought applied math would have access to the more theoretical CS mathy stuff than it does. I'm not really sure how to answer the ""did you have prior CS exposure"" question because I don't want it to seem like I'm somehow trying to game the system.

Anything I should watch out for? How ""safe"" am I if I get all As?

1) Went to the ER for a dental tooth abscess 
2) Went to the ER for high blood pressure 
3) Got denied dental treatment due to high blood pressure 
4) Doctor can’t find the source of the high blood pressure 
5) Suddenly started developing new floaters in my eyes 
6) Getting sued by an old credit card company and for an old debt  (when I used to own my business) 
7) Developed severe health anxiety 
8) Failing one class I absolutely have no idea how to even understand the concept 
9) Have no family or friends here - feel so alone, depressed, and sad
10) Left my dog at home when he was my source of happiness 
11) Rethinking my major 
12) developed paranoia 
13) can’t shake the imposter syndrome

Passing out at Lorde Concert,"I know a lot of people camped out for hours to get into the Greek Theatre, but what I don’t understand is why so many people were passing out. Before Lorde even came on stage, two people in the pit had already fainted. Then during the show, it had to be stopped twice because more people passed out. Even after that, staff had to keep going into the crowd throughout the night. I counted at least 5 or 6 incidents. It was honestly wild!

If you’re planning to camp out, please take care of yourselves. Bring food and water, drink electrolytes, and pack cooling items like mini fans. They’re super cheap and make a big difference. I get that some things are out of our control, but staying hydrated and prepared is important, especially when you're standing for hours in tightly packed crowds where it gets hot fast. It sucks that people didn’t fully get to experience the concert because they had to see the medical team because they were having medical emergencies.

It literally is just an insult to our culture. If you can't make it right don't make it at all. THANK YOU!

Worse than my worst nightmare - failed midterm,"Everyone’s had that nightmare where you sit down for a test and suddenly forget everything you studied. I actually had that dream about this midterm two weeks ago It was terrifying, so I locked in and studied hard to make sure it wouldn’t come true.

Fast forward to yesterday at 5 PM in Evans Hall: I got the test, read through every question, and it was tough, but I had a plan for how to tackle it and manage the math.(my weakness) Then, worse than I could’ve imagined… **the pep rally started.**

It was awful. The MC was screaming into the mic, blasting high-energy songs. I started crying right there, trying to wipe my tears before they hit the paper. I just couldn’t concentrate. I kept trying to calm down and refocus, but I couldn’t recall the intricate math details I’d worked so hard to learn. I know I failed. I ended up leaving the midterm in tears.

I’m still feeling really down, plagued with imposter syndrome. This is mostly a rant, but if anyone’s ever had a testing disaster and bounced back, I’d love to hear how you recovered. I could use some encouragement right now.

At least Berkeley won their game, I guess.

I need to complain about RSF,"Let me start by saying that I am qualified to speak on this issue because this is my second time at Cal after finishing undergrad in 2016 (I’m getting my MA currently). The RSF has made virtually zero improvements to any part of the space in almost ten years, and I’m completely over it. I don’t even know where to start. 

Let’s talk about the size. I’m no expert on university gyms, but for the size of Berkeley, this gym feels comically small - hence, why it’s packed at all hours. Someone mentioned in another post that while the student body grows every year, the RSF stays the same. There are the ten or so smaller rooms on the cardio floor (which could be consolidated and made into a larger functional space) but at least half of them are completely empty and unused at all times. It makes absolutely no sense. 

Next, the machines. Oh my god. Not only are most of them old, but at any given time in the weight room, expect 10% of the machines to be broken or defective in some way (this applies to the cardio machines, too). 

Now let’s talk about cleanliness. The place STINKS. There are minimal fans running and zero AC. The weight room gets extremely stuffy and smells like a$$, and the mirrors on the wall are consistently dirty and grimy. I get the sense that the place hasn’t been properly sanitized in years. Half of the wet wipe stations are always empty. 

I’m not sure if this is a public university issue or something entirely different, but I’m astounded at how awful RSF is these days. I visited my sister once at Cal Poly and the gym was an absolute dream. 

I love Berkeley, I really do (why else would I be here for a second time), but the RSF is an absolute embarrassment. The money to improve the facility exists, it’s just clearly not a priority.

Please help - Lost my mom's watch somewhere in Berkeley. Devastated.,"[EDIT: I found my watch!!!! Thank you everyone I appreciate you all so much!! I got it from U Dessert earlier today. If I’m just responding to you I’m sorry - I immediately went to take a midterm 😭]

Hey Berkeley,

I'm reaching out because I'm honestly heartbroken and need your help.

I lost my mother's watch somewhere around Berkeley on Thursday, October 9th. The clasp was loose and it just fell off without me noticing - I didn't realize until the next day when I went to check the time.

This watch isn't just a watch to me. My mom wore this every single day for over 20 years. Seeing it on my wrist reminds me of her and keeps me connected to her. Losing it feels like I've lost a piece of her.

**What it looks like:**

* Brand: Citizen Quartz (says ""CITIZEN QUARTZ"" on the face)
* Style: Dainty women's dress watch with a rectangular/elongated face
* Band: Gold-tone metal bracelet with a delicate link pattern
* Face: White/cream textured dial with gold hands and simple hour markers
* Size: Small/petite women's watch, very lightweight
* The watch has a classic, elegant vintage look

**Where I was that day:** Downtown Berkeley

I know Berkeley is a big place and this is probably a needle in a haystack, but this community has always come through for people. I've seen you all reunite people with lost pets, wallets, and even keys.

If you were walking around Ace Apartments on October 9th and saw a watch on the ground, or if you work at a business in the area and someone turned one in - please, please DM me.

Thoughts on an off campus luxury apartment?,"Recently, this new off-campus luxury apartment was tabling on Sproul and caught my roommate. It’s still in the process of being built.

I am a little bit skeptical because we haven't seen the building in real life, we don't know how big one room is, and they're also SO SO desperate to get us to sign (they offered us a $250 visa gift card if we signed a lease within the next 72 hours, which I feel like would not be the smartest idea). For the floor plans that they have available, it's $999 per month per person to share a triple. I think it’s a little expensive but maybe not entirely undoable. But I do feel like it would be kinda silly to sign a lease for a house we haven’t even seen. Has anyone else gone on tours as well? What do you guys think?

identity logan park lease renewal,"hey guys! So currently im staying in a double at identity logan park and I really like the apartment however today is the last day to renew my lease for the 2026-2027 year before they start increasing rates &amp; opening the apartment spot to the public. I dont want to renew my lease just yet because it's way too early and I dont want to commit to a year long financial contract when i've only been staying here for like 2 months. So far everything is good and I like my roommates (my roommates have renewed their lease). 

At the same time I don't want to lose my spot here. I was hoping to renew around feb/march next yr (assuming all is well). Was wondering if anyone has any idea if the risk of someone taking my spot is high? My logic is that its only october and not many people are looking for housing this time of year since its legit the beginning but any advice would help... thank you!

I miss Berkeley so much,"
I don’t usually make posts like this, but I just felt like speaking a bit.

I went back home for a semester (I’m international), and it’s been, too weirdly quiet. Being away from campus made me realize how much life there actually gives me: the noise, the stress, the random small talks after class, friends, even just walking through campus half-asleep for an 8am lecture. It all felt tiring in the moment, but now I’d give anything to be there again.

At home, everything’s slower. My friends are busy with their own things, and the days start blending into each other. I miss my people, my girlfriend, just my live was there. Berkeley can be tough, but it’s the kind of chaos that keeps you alive — like, you complain about it constantly, but secretly love it.

Can’t wait to come back and start struggling again lol.

If you’re there right now, really, appreciate it. The little things, the late nights, the random laughs, the walks across campus when the air feels just right. You’ll miss them more than you think",berkeley,-0.23,Mental Health

Think the natural foods movement, farm to table dining, meditation and mindfulness, vegetarianism, ecoconciousness, and chez panisse.

UC Transfer Struggling with Degree Reqs,"Hi everyone!

  
I just transferred from UC Riverside as a double major in English and Education. I know the majority of transfers here are from CC, so it makes sense that there isn't a lot of information for transfer credit counting towards degree class reqs for UC or other 4 year institution transfers. But currently, I was told by an Education advisor that the education courses that I took at UCR probably wouldn't count towards my major reqs here. I'm just a bit confused as to why they can't count, or if anyone else has encountered something similar? I'm double majoring, which already means I have a bit more course load to juggle, but now I've been told that it's possible I'll have to start my education degree from scratch. Has anyone else been through a similar issue, and if so, what did you do to fix it? 

  
I'm also just frustrated with this entire thing because I spent the majority of my 2 years at UCR trying to finish my general eds. 1: because I was told it's probably best to do so if I wanted to transfer (though that may be outdated info at this point), and 2: UCR seems to emphasize a lot more on general eds than Berkeley, because we had to complete about 17 courses for our general eds whereas here we only need to do 7. So now I'm stuck with all these general eds that I don't even know can count towards my graduation reqs, and a bunch of incomplete major classes that counted at UCR but don't count here. 

  
Does anyone know what I can do to fix this situation? I've already submitted some of the syllabi of my education courses back at Riverside to my advisory, hoping they can count them towards my major at this point. ",berkeley,-0.33,Academics

Berkeley vs USC Rigor Rant,"Okay so my boyfriend goes to USC and usually he comes and visits me up here. But this weekend I went to go visit him, which we don’t do often because it’s easier and cheaper for him to come to me. Either way, I told him weeks in advance that I had a midterm that week and that I would NEED to spend that weekend studying. I explained that this class has 2 exams that makeup the grade and nothing else, so this was obviously really important. My typical midterm study schedule, the one I’ve used for my midterms the past two weeks have been: rest day Friday, 6 hrs sat, 6 hrs sun, 6 hrs Monday (AT LEAST). ^(don’t have class M, F). I try my best to develop a job-like routine because I’m taking 21 units (16 Berkeley, 5 CC). Now, I’m a double major in economics and legal studies (working towards CPA hence CC), and he is a business of film major. I do understand that we don’t do the same things exactly so like I can’t expect him to understand what it is EXACTLY that I do. BUT I feel like this weekend I studied maybe 6ish hours  (Non-Consecutive) and he 
wanted to leave for half of them. Like he was so appalled at the idea of staying at the library all day - something he claims he has never done. (Even though I said that’s what I needed to do). I really do always bag on him about how USC is a joke and how like we have so many Nobel Prizes, the academic rigor, etc.  I’ve always felt that we functioned in two different worlds academically because BERKELEY IS FUCKING HARD AND YOU NEED TO STUDY HARD AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL. Guess a part of me just wonders if it is the difference in our majors or the difference in our schools.

I am working on a story about companies like Conduit (https://condu.it) that pay people from the Bay Area off Craigslist to come in and help train AI products, with pay from $25-30 per hour, or more. Meta and others have also been doing this around the area. There are a bunch of companies also asking people to strap cameras to their heads and record themselves completing tasks, to help train robotics and other tools.

How do I know I’m in the right major (math),"I’m a junior at Berkeley, and a math major. Honestly, at this point in my life I feel mainly anxiety around math. I feel happy pretty much only when I finally understand something or get a decent grade or whatever. But when I’m doing homework, studying, in class or whatever, I mainly feel extremely anxious. I feel anxious when I don’t get it, constantly afraid that I’m not smart enough, afraid that I’m wasting time and afraid that possibly my skill set is meant for something else. If any math majors see this, how do you know math is for you? It would kill me to start over this far in, and I can’t tell if I would regret quitting or if I’d regret staying. For context I do in fact have an anxiety disorder and no I’m not on meds (was for a few years). Is the anxiety something to get past and cope with? Or is it a sign? Would I be this anxious in a different, maybe non-stem, major??

Any advice would be awesome.

When does the suffering end,"Hyperbolic title lol but still. In the ~two months I’ve been here I feel like I’ve learned so much and there’s an overwhelming obvious quality to the education yet I just don’t feel particularly happy and all of my friends feel the same way. I’ve never been known to be a cynical person (historically pretty optimistic in fact) but it’s so hard to keep in high spirits and stay motivated to *meet* the quality of the education I’m receiving because I have such an aversion to the school’s culture and the town itself. I’ve never been so lethargic in my life. 

On here, I see a lot of people say that their first 2 years were miserable but then suddenly something clicked and it all got better, but I’m a transfer and only have 2 years lol. I also feel kind of directionless and, as someone who is majoring in the humanities, as I’m not sure how far the Berkeley name will get me postgrad when Berkeley is known for STEM, and even the on-campus culture illuminates how this is truly a STEM school that happens to have L&amp;S as opposed to being truly multidisciplinary (and the humanities department is dirt poor here—their words not mine). 

I transferred from a very small liberal arts &amp; comms school on the east coast which i loved but was stupid expensive, yet I was so much happier and way more motivated to be an A+ student and involved with orgs and stuff there because of the happiness. It was just more manageable. The bureaucracy here makes me feel insane… tried to make an advising meeting at L&amp;S to ground myself and my plan here a bit more which I’d been waiting weeks for and it was canceled at 2 am the morning-of because the advisor “wasn’t feeling well.” It was via zoom!!! What!!! Ugh. I’m rambling now… my point being is that I’m not sure I made the right choice in being here at all aside from the financial relief with the in-state tuition.

Where do Berkeley students usually hear about fun campus challenges or new apps?,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m part of a small Bay-Area-based startup, and we’re launching something fun specifically for Berkeley students — kind of a “live better” challenge with some real money prizes.

Before we announce anything, I’m trying to figure out where students actually notice things these days. 

Like…
1. Are most students still reading Facebook groups?
2. Or is it mostly Discord servers, club group chats, or campus newsletters?
3. Do you check Reddit for stuff like that, or mostly see it through friends / orgs / Insta stories?

If you’re a current student (or recent alum), we’d love to hear what channels you actually notice or trust on campus. 🙏

Thanks in advance — and if anyone’s curious about the challenge idea, happy to share more once we figure out the right channels to post it.",berkeley,-0.23,Finance

Even if you're not sure if you'll come to a meeting, it's free to sign up, so why not? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sign up for major discounts to use Ninja Warrior training facilities with your friends with several coaches at your fingertips!

  
Important information:

\- There are courses and training opportunities for ALL skill levels and levels of commitment. Interested in competing? We got you. Just want to goof off with some friends in a more exciting playground? We're there. Want to humble some egos, maybe even your own? Go for it! Need to get some zoomies out in a new, extremely discounted, and awesome environment? Sign up!

\- The gym gets updated pretty frequently which different courses/obstacles being altered or replaced in some way, so it will probably be a little different every time that you come :) You can also make your own course that staff can time you in (to compete with friends or just to see how fast you are), or the staff can make one for you!

\- We do NOT have a schedule set up yet, and are making it based on YOUR schedule, so please use the link in the general-info channel to let us know when you are available!

\- Officers have not been chosen yet, so if you are even a little interested, let us know! 

\- We \*WILL\* be getting epic discounts on the gym, less than $15 but actual numbers are still up in the air.

\- If you really like the gym, you can get more private lessons! While they are not advertised as one-on-one, they are extremely intimate because this gym is not super popular, so you might get a one-on-one class

\- Because this gym is not extremely popular (it's just a pretty niche thing, there is nothing wrong with the gym at ALL. A handful of clubs at Cal went to check it out last Friday and it was INCREDIBLE), it is usually pretty empty too!

\- The gym is in Richmond, so there is a commute necessary, but it is not very long. Here is the gym if you want to check it out: [Home | Traverse Fitness](https://www.traversefit.com/)

Berkeley CS grads blacklisted due to cheating on interviews,"Let me preface this by saying that this is not a rigorous study, but an anecdote from an experienced tech worker at an SV start up that is growing rapidly and primarily employs software engineers. I did not attend Berkeley but always admired and generally get along with my coworkers who did. I've been a guest at your campus many times.

My company has been in hiring mode for the past few months and conducts multiple interviews every day. As with many VC-backed start ups, we prioritize interviewing engineers from big tech companies and graduates from top schools, which includes Berkeley. 

It should surprise no one that unauthorized AI and LLM usage is a growing problem in many areas, including hiring. It's especially problematic because it's often not possible to say that someone's answer definitively was not their own, even if it's strongly suspected during early interview rounds. That's all to say that there is a degree of uncertainty until a candidate comes on site and can be tested in a controlled environment.

I lead a team adjacent to the engineering org and speak with their hiring managers and interviewers frequently about process and hiring status. Lately, nearly every interviewer I've spoken to has said the same thing: cheating is rampant, and Berkeley grads are the worst offenders.

I'm posting this here because I still have a lot of respect for your unviersity and hope that this trend can be turned around. Cheating doesn't only affect the person doing it, but reflects badly on your school and can impact your classmates'/alumni job prospects as well. We probably won't consider new grads from Berkeley for a while, at least in engineering, as a result. And that is a shame.",berkeley,-0.33,Politics

Meeting People is Hard / Falsely Advertised,"hi, i don't mean to join the sea of posts complaining about this specific topic but coming in as a transfer student seems absolutely miserable. my biggest fear going to a big college was that it'd be just like community college where i didn't really get to know too many people until i was like, already moving. for context i have had one friend group that started in middle school and has stuck together through online outlets like discord and instagram. i love those people dearly, they're the life in my veins that pushes me to keep going. but i would like to meet new people.

my orientation went great and i loved hanging out with the people there, but we didn't stick as well as i'd hoped and i've barely talked to any of them since. my next bet was to talk to people from my classes, which i did to some extent. however, they became more like work acquaintances than real frends. so, naturally, i went to clubs, namely the guitar club since i have been interested in learning guitar. when i went, though, i was surrounded by pre-established friend groups of 2-4 people who had been going already. outside of the icebreaker i never opened my mouth there. maybe that's my fault for not going out of my way to talk to people, i don't know. seeing as that wasn't working, i stopped going.

this is all happening while i live in a double with my roommate, who seemed to get along with the other people in our building just fine, though all my efforts to get close with them were fruitless. i feel isolated in my own home of all places.

it just felt like every time one of my efforts failed, i'd try something else, only to be shot down again. the last time i tried to talk to someone, it was in the memorial union outside the little snack spot they have there. i got myself some crappy gummies and ate on one of the tables nearby. sitting in the table in front of me was someone with a bag of spicy doritos, interestingly they folded the bag up when they were done. i thought that was really funny for some reason so i wanted to ask why they did it. but they were just on their phone for a long ass time. i ended up leaving, ashamed i never talked to them due to shyness... i turned my head to see what they were doing on their phone, and lo and behold do i see the iphone control panel. i guess maybe i was making them uncomfortable, and they were using their phone because they didn't want to talk to me.

then i just had a mental break. not like a violent, crying one, but just a silent rage type of one. i went on amazon and ordered an electric guitar and amp. if i'm not spending my time socializing, then i'll just embrace being isolated and fuck off to practice elsewhere.

what's shocking to me is all my life, people have been telling me ""you'll meet your people in college."" so where are they? i'm here and i've never felt lonelier in my entire life. just really feels falsely advertised, lol.

someone made a post a couple days ago about how all the days seem blurred together. i feel like i couldn't relate more. every day just feels like i'm going through the motions because i have to, but the force that makes my legs move gets weaker by the day. i've never wondered ""what's the point?"" as much as i have now. it helps to know i'm not the only one at least

i'm not really making this post for advice on what to do, rather i just want to evoke a similar feeling as the other person's post did; you are not alone. i'll get this damn degree even if i have to do it out of spite and through an isolated struggle. i don't care, i just need to get out of here as fast as possible.",UCDavis,-0.43,Mental Health

Looking for ways to meet smart and thoughtful people in Davis,"I graduated two years ago and have found it difficult to make close friends in Davis. I've been putting myself out there and met some cool people, but haven't found someone who I click with on a deeper level.

I am looking for people who are thoughtful, smart, left-brained, and broadly curious. I get that small talk has its place, but I want people who appreciate deeper conversations.

"2025-2026 ASSIST for UC Davis shows few or no prep classes for many majors, esp engineering. Real change or not updated yet?","Hi Aggies. My kid is planning a transfer for Fall 2026 and checking ASSIST for 2025-2026. For a bunch of UC Davis majors, it looks like almost no lower-division prep is listed. Engineering looks the most wild. Last year there were clear series listed. Now it feels like almost nothing is required.



Is anyone else seeing this?



Key questions:



* Are the 2025-2026 UC Davis agreements final, or still being updated?
* If they are not final, when does ASSIST usually get fully updated each year?
* For planning right now, should we follow 2024-2025, the UC Davis catalog, UC Transfer Pathways, or College of Engineering advising pages?
* Any official note from UCD or ASSIST about this change or a delay?
* If you already talked to a UC Davis advisor, what did they say about using last year’s agreements vs the new ones?

Excess unit petition for switching majors,"Currently a 3rd year CSE major trying to switch into a double major in EE and CE with a CS minor. I submitted my change of major petition a week ago after attending the change of major workshop. This week, one of the ECE advisors reached out to me asking me to submit an excess unit petition since I've reached 140.5 units (13.5 of them were from community college classes I took) and anyone who wants to switch majors after hitting 135 units needs to submit that petition and the way the advisors were talking about it made it seem like there was a chance it could get denied.

I already filled out the petition and sent it back to the advisors. I followed up and asked more about it and they were saying that I would probably have to wait until December before I can fully switch my major because that's when the UGEP committee meets. What can I do to make sure that this petition gets approved? Because I heard if it gets denied then that would mean I can't switch majors and there's nothing I can do. All of the classes I have taken so far would count towards the EE/CE double major or the CS minor and I have close to a 4.0 GPA. I just went 5 units over that 135 unit threshold. 

I know I might be worrying too much but I really don't want to continue with CSE and I really want to do stuff with hardware and electronics. I've heard that most of those petitions get approved especially because college of engineering doesn't have the unit cap but I'm genuinely kind of worried about what I'm going to do if it gets denied.",UCDavis,-0.23,Academics

Avoid Tanglewood@Davis!,"Hello friends, if you are considering living in Tanglewood@Davis, please avoid this place at all your cost. 

TLDR: 
1. Threatened to kick us out because we said no pre-moveout carpet inspection, even though it is agreed on paper previously and signed by me, my roommates, and the leasing office. Picture attached in this review.
2. Charged us almost $2400 after we move out for “wear and tear” in addition to $1100 deposit
3. We paid rent + utility timely the first day of EVERY month, still charged $550 extra after move out cuz “we did not pay for utility for the last 3 months of stay”.
4. Some people in management team are very passive aggressive during communication. 

Attached pics: 
1. Letter to kick us out if we don’t give permission for inspection 
2. Original repair invoice after we move out 
3. Corrected repair invoice 

Here’s the longer story if you wanna kill some time 

1. Me and 2 other friends lived here 9/23-9/25. 6 months before we moved out, we signed a document with the leasing office, saying we do not want any pre-moveout inspection because all of us will be gone during summer and will not have time to clean up before the pre-moveout inspection. In 7/25, which is 1.5 months before our official move out date, we received a notice stocked on our door saying the leasing office will do pre-move out carpet inspection in 3 days. Mind you non of us were in Davis, the only way we found out about this is because my partner was grabbing some stuff from my room and saw the notice. We argued with the manager, Kyra, who said the leasing office had every right to enter our apartment since they put out the notice 72 hrs in advance. The next day, fulling aware none of us were in Davis, she put another notice on our door, threatened to kick us out if we do not give permission for the inspection. We reminded them multiple times that we already signed a document 6 months prior saying we do not want any inspection. Eventually they gave in. 

2. After move out, they charged us $2400 extra outside of $1100 deposit. The carpet and vinyl were already 9 years old, which is approaching the use limit (they change all the carpet and vinyl every 10 years). Despite approaching use time limit, they charged us FULL AMOUNT for vinyl replacement. We argued with leasing office for almost a month before they got back to us and correct the invoice. 

3. Charged us $550 extra for the last 3 months of utility before we move out because “we did not pay”. However, we paid rent and utility timely on the first day of every month. After showing them screenshots, they still deny the mistake. Called them, I was on the phone for 30 minutes with a guy, explaining that we were charged extra and they need to fix the invoice, but the person didn’t know what’s going on and was trying to convince me that we did not pay. 

4. The whole process of communicating with the team back and forth was EXTREMELY frustrating because they will not admit their mistakes. After arguing with them a whole months, they finally agreed to correct the invoice and gave our deposit back. I cannot imagine how many tenants they have charged extra after moveout and how much money they made off people who do not have the habit of arguing with the leasing office. ",UCDavis,-0.93,Finance

Statement from Geology Club at UC Davis,"Hi everyone, I am one of the two presidents of the Geology Club here at Davis. Earlier today, we learned from this subreddit that a member of our club has allegedly sexually harassed several students at the library. This situation is currently being investigated by police and campus administration. We have received feedback from other club members that they are not comfortable with this individual attending meetings or trips, especially if they are overnight. In response to this, my copresident and I have decided to remove this individual from the club discord and any scheduled field trips and activities, and they will be prohibited from participating in any club events. We have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and intimidation in our club and community and we prioritize the safety and comfort of our members above all else.

SDC registration accomodations,"I'm a freshman at UC Davis and class registration causes me a great deal of anxiety (GAD and probably some sort of panic disorder). For these first few weeks of the quarter I've learned some things about my class scheduling due to a couple poorly timed anxiety attacks. I feel I would benefit greatly from having some sort of way to relieve stress surrounding making sure I get the classes I need to take, and being able to take them in a relatively favourable time (ie I have a tendency to do worse later in the day because my social battery can only get me so far). One of my childhood friends was saying I should talk with the SDC to see if there's anything they can do like moving my pass time up enough to guarantee a large chunk of my classes are earlier or spaced well enough to prevent unnecessary stress. I call it stress but it genuinely feels like I'm dying at random intervals and it's starting to interfere with my classes and sleep. I will take any help or suggestions at this point so do any of you have experience with this? And if the SDC can't do anything, is there a way you've overcome or combatted this kind of anxiety?",UCDavis,-0.43,Mental Health

That means I cannot be a bus driver because I'm not able to get CDL from DMV. I searched some news about that probably because the bad crash happened in Florida. The driver is an illegal immigrant from India. (So FTA asked all state DMV to stop issuing CDL to foreigner?)

first quarter. my days are blending together,"transferred from a cc this past fall and started my first quarter here. I've been feeling so uninspired and weirdly hopeless recently.

right off the bat I was a little devastated on the first day of move-in. I was sobbing on the floor of my dorm because the bare walls were making me nauseous. I had a hard time letting go of my parents. they kept telling me id do great and they're so proud of me. the last thing i wanted was to drop my arms from them and feel theirs drop from me and watch them drive away. trying to recall the first few days seems so strange and unfamiliar, like that was never actually a part of my timeline. Just events in my head that dont make any sense at all. 

one of the first people who tried to talk to me was a drunk guy who followed me home from a party. party itself was extremely dull. i saw people around me having a good time. i was trying to have a good time too but it felt impossible. dude saw me standing by myself and told me he was going to leave with me. it was entertaining until i couldn't go back to my dorm because he was so set on coming back with me. i watched him puke on the sidewalk like 4 times before i finally convinced him to text his roommate to come pick him up.

orientation was so bleak as well. i tried talking to people but it seems like i just wasn't what they were looking for. they were more interested in each other.

since classes have started everything has just felt the same. i still dont have the stupid roads memorized here because everything feels chaotic and pointless. i sometimes go a whole day without opening my mouth because i dont have anyone to talk to. the past few weeks have blended into a single memory of giant ceiling lights and back pain and the image of the back of everyones heads. i dont know what to do next. i wish i could take a nap that was heavy enough to fix all of this.",UCDavis,-0.73,Mental Health

totally bombed a midterm,"this is my first quarter at uc davis (im a biosci major) and im taking mat17a. we just got our first midterm back and i did horrible. like pretty below average. i feel like i know why and i dont really want to go into detail, but just know i genuinely did study to the best of my ability. any time i take a test my mind blanks and i get super anxious, then for math i make so many dumb mistakes which screws up my score and all. exams are worth 80% of our grade (45% midterms and 35% final) and they aren’t curved - i believe our cumulative grade will be curved at the end of the quarter, but i feel worse knowing most people in my class did relatively well. honestly im just thinking about how i can go about this because realistically i have a feeling i wont ace future exams in that class. i’m at a d+ right now and i know it can raise in the future, it’s just i really need some advice on what to do now and how to cope. i’m pretty sure my chances of getting an a are now gone. i’m really down in the dumps and lost my motivation even though midterm season just started. i have more midterms coming really soon but im just so out of it.

The Old Teahouse: review of what was good/disappointing,"I decided to go try The Old Teahouse now that it's back! I went to the old version lots of times, before the UMall closed in 2023.

When I got there, I didn't see the Beef Bowl combo ($14.95) they had on their online order website. There was an $18.99 version though. I decided to go for the $12.99 crispy chicken combo instead. I picked medium spiciness, out of mild-medium-hot. 

The chicken came out first, a few minutes before the tea. Some notes:

*  It was unseasoned. Not just un-spicy, unseasoned (not even salt), like they forgot to season it. I checked my receipt, it said ""medium"", so it couldn't have been an ordering error. There didn't seem to be any ""add your own seasoning"" station either, so it wasn't that.
* It was not hot, only somewhat warm. 
* It was a bit soggy.
* Came in a paper bag, not a box. (I'm guessing because they just opened, no boxes yet?)

The chicken was definitely a far cry from what it used to be, or what iTea/Raretea/anyplace else offer.  I guess it had been sitting a while. Especially since it had no seasoning, not good.

Then the tea came. I got the House Boba Milk Tea, not bad! Notes:

* Good strong tea flavor, similar to what I remember.
* Nice tall size.
* Good boba texture.
* I ordered 25% sweetness - perfect. Not too sweet.

Other general notes

* Nice staff! Clean place. I like the flowers.
* The music was uncomfortably loud.
* No kiosk ordering
* Only a few tables inside. The old place was kinda like this, but even fewer.

Overall, I'm not planning to go back for a while. I know it will get better as they get back into their groove.",UCDavis,-0.23,Housing

My mom is all I got, and we can't afford this. Not this year. She's working hard to pay off a lawyer. I was so happy when I showed her my $88 dollars a month. Felt like I did my part. 
How can they do that, tempt someone into thinking they earned a four year degree, that life outside the forgetten parts of LA is at all possible? Kicked in the teeth by a boot, that's what this feels like.

"random app idea, would you use it","kinda like instagram notes: u can set it to just your close friends, or an even smaller selection of people, or like everyone you know, possibly everyone at uc davis even, for example??. but its like you have a little thought bubble and its like ""Thinking of going to Target"" or ""want to play volleyball at the ARC"" and you set a general time in the future for this activity, possibly add a location too, you want to do in your thought bubble with it.

and then your friends can reply to the thought bubble and say if they're down to join you for that activity. so all of your friends can have their own thought bubbles and you can reply to them too to join them. it's like a no pressure way of asking any of your friends if you want to do something together, because you're going to do it anyway if no one joins you but it gently allows people to join you on mundane things if they happen to be nearby and available for that time. 

its different from asking someone directly cause you aren't like arranging an official ""meeting"" or ""appointment"" time with anybody and its like a more casual version of When2Meet. and its a little more spontaneous instead of planned if u happen to find the time to join somebody on an adventure. this is useful for university students who live pretty close to each other generally and want to go on random side quests with their friends

maybe only issue is that it would have to be mainstream enough like instagram for all your friends to join, i just kind of wish this existed. or maybe instagrams development team should hire me lol. but idk is this just something we should use instagram notes for?? but i feel like when u post a instagram note people won't take it as seriously and it doesn't really look  like u are asking anyone to join u specifically. what do u think??",UCDavis,-0.23,Other

Want to become a Research Software Engineer?,"The increasing use of digital technologies across research communities has gone hand in hand with a strong growth and reliance on software written or customized to solve research problems: research software. This, in turn, is driving dialog around opportunities to:

* improve the development of research software, and
* incentivize useful sharing, curation, and ongoing maintenance of research software artifacts and related knowledge.

Of course, research software does not develop, curate, or maintain itself. Accordingly, widespread research software growth has included emerging roles for people who create, maintain, and contribute to the research software ecosystem. These roles can bring value directly through enabling specific research projects. They also bring value indirectly, through helping ensure enduring impact of research software innovations and by facilitating adequate reproducibility standards in digital science.

Our group is looking for students that either want to become a research software engineer or want to improve their software development skills.

We have activities for students that are able to commit large or small amounts of time.

Bike Stolen from Orchard Park on Video (See Caption),"Yesterday morning, at 5am (October 18th 2025) my friend's bike was stolen from Orchard Park. He had it parked in the bike parking lot between 5019 and 5017, right in front of the door to 5017 and a security camera. He had an orange Kryptonite U-Lock securely attached to the frame and bike parking.

We came out around 8am to go shopping, only to find his U-Lock on the ground sawed in half. Then, a man (shout out Kendrick) came up asking if we had lost a bike. He proceeded to tell us that around 4am he heard an angle grinder and an awful smell coming from the bike parking lot. Then he took this video about an hour later, and  confronted the guy trying to load the bike into his truck. He said he was able to wrestle the bike away from the guy, scare him off, and turn it into the police. This dude was an actual saint, thank you kind stranger. 

  
We're still waiting on any possible security camera footage, but not particularly hopeful on the thief being identified by the police. 

Just wanted to share for anyone who also parks in the area. Even with the ""best"" lock, if a thief really wants your bike they will get through it, and most people will not be so lucky to have an angel like Kendrick descend upon Orchard Park and save your bike.

rant,"do any other asians also relate to this? growing up asian here in the U.S. was lowkey a struggle due to the many racist stereotypes and comments that were made about us, from being called “rice eaters” and to being called weird for liking kpop or anime. but now, all those same things we used to get made fun of for liking are being celebrated and is the trend right now. and i know those same girls who used to make fun of asians are mass collecting labubus and hello kitty. i’m not bitter but im glad people are recognizing our influence and our culture. anime, kpop, sanrio, labubu, popmart, matcha, hotpot, boba, etc .. YES that all came from Asia thank you we are the original. comments such as “oh it’s that asian girl from class” emphasizing on the asian part as if it was an insult to be called asian? like yes im asian and i’m proud of it. i love my culture and my food. the same things y’all are obsessing over 😭 we grew up with them, you just copy the trend",UCDavis,-0.33,Social
i never actually learn anything in class plz help (sorry long tangent),"I’m a freshman and i know college is a whole new diff way of learning but as i’m studying  for midterms i realized i haven’t learned anything in class. not cuz my profs suck but bc i genuinely don’t absorb anything how do i actually understand stuff if that makes sense 

for example my mat 21c class is so fast pace and the concepts we’re learning is actually some i already know but it’s so fast i can barely take notes and understand at the same time. so when doing hw im literally teaching myself but i dont fully get the concepts in the way i fully should 

and in my ecs 36b class its 8am so maybe its just hard to pay attention early but i feel like im following along and it makes sense but i realize when i try to code on my own, i dont know wtf i’m doing, and my notes didn’t even help me much 

 in both these classes i end up just referencing the slides cuz my notes are useless but idk i just don’t get how when i get to class i try to follow a long, i make an effort, i do the hw and nothing sticks 

i do the hw on time and sometimes i procrastinate at the last minute but it gets done, but idk i just dont feel confident in my subject, like wtf am i doing i feel like im just self teaching and im learning nothing in class 

if yall have any advice it would be really appreciative im sorry if i sounds like ur average freshman who finally realized college is hard ",UCDavis,-0.53,Academics

Pet PSA,"Pets are a **long-term commitment.** They cost money, get sick, make messes, and grow from cute babies into full-grown animals with needs, personalities, and quirks. Some of them will live **20 years or more.**

If you buy or adopt an animal without the ability or desire to care for it long-term,  you are a **piece of shit.** Try not to be one of these morons you will find here from time to time posting about how after a lot of hard thought they now **URGENTLY** need someone to take their pet or pets in for them inexplicably as they either graduate or move on short notice. 

Thank you for your time and do try to be considerate towards animals as they are not a fashion accessory and it is wrong to just throw them away whenever. Look no further than the stray cat colonies we have in west village. ",UCDavis,-0.83,Social

Can I still get my UC Davis email reopened and have all my previous data if it's about to close (read below for context)?,"Hi all! 

For context, I graduated back in June and I'm an alumni. I just received the email about how my UC Davis account is about to close in a few days, but I was wondering if I can still keep my account and data if I recently got hired at UC Davis. I sent a ticket to IT about this, but they're closed on the weekend so I'm afraid of my account will be automatically closed before they get to my ticket. Basically, if my account gets closed, can it still get reopened with all my previous data if I start a new job at UC Davis? Or will I have to transfer all my data to another account?

Walking alone at Night in Davis,"Posting more photos I took alone at night!

I personally don't recommend anyone else to walk alone at night. Take it from me: Just because we’re dumb\*\*\*\*\* doesn’t mean you should be too. Stay safe, bring a buddy or group, and maybe just Uber next time you find yourself far from home!",UCDavis,-0.43,Mental Health

[URGENT] Looking for a home for my chinchillas! (reposting),"Hi all! We posted about this before, but we are in URGENT need of finding homes for these cuties! If you can rehome them, please help us sharing this information!! 

With a lot of pain in my heart, I'm posting because I need to rehome my 3 chinchillas. I'm a grad student, I need to move out of my place, and it would be irresponsible to keep the chinchillas with me, probably without being able to provide the care they need. And as I love them so much, I want to give them the chance to find a home that can provide the care they deserve. Of course, if people need the enclosures and all their supplies and toys, they can take them.

The dad was rescued from a really abusive house, and his two kids were born on Feb of 2024. Unfortunately, their mom passed away when they were only a few days old and we bottle fed them until they were happy and healthy. The two boys live in an enclosure (dad and son), and the girl lives in her own enclosure:

\-Pierre Jean-Jacques (1st picture): The dad. He can be grumpy, and he can try to soft bite you if the reason of interaction is anything different than food. But he is the greatest dad ever and after the baby's mom died, he would protect them, groom them, and caress them. And in a good day, he can get some pets in between running sessions (oh! he loves to run, run and run... in their wheel). Note: Pierre was seriously neglected, he got cataracts, and he missed a couple of toes. Nonetheless, last time the vet checked him (at UC Davis Small Animals clinic) they said Pierre was healthy. They believe he is 8+ year old. When I rescued him, he would not let anyone approach the cage, he used to bite everyone and used to pee all over the walls. We made a huge progress, and with his son, he has seemed a lot more active and open to humans.

\-Luigi Salvatore (aka. Lou-Lou, Lou) (2nd picture): Lou is sweetheart. He loves food and he loves pets. He is by far the biggest (same size as his mom). He likes to run and likes to jump around the different levels of his enclosure, but at a moderate level of energy. Eventually he runs in the wheel, but his favorite activity (other than napping) is to chew apple sticks!

\-Delilah Agatha (aka. Dee, Dee-dee, Dee-dee the dasher) (3rd picture): She is a whole different story, she loves humans paying attention to her and she loves pets and play time. She loves cleaning time, and she will try to take everything you're using around her cage. She jumps from one level to the other in a second and you're not paying attention; she will try to make a run through the door.

They are located in Sacramento, CA and I work in Davis, CA. Again, this is really a hard decision to take but we want to give them the chance to find the best home possible and avoid jeopardizing their wellbeing. Let me know if you have any questions!",UCDavis,-0.23,Housing

Draw People/Get Drawn!,"Hi guys, I'm trying to start a figure drawing/portrait club in Davis and so far have had terrible success on facebook and other apps so I am checking out reddit! The club idea is to gather in a park or public place, and we will take turns holding still/modeling for \~five minute and draw each other, so that we can all practice portrait/figure drawing from life! No skill level required. The focus of the group is to provide an opportunity to practice drawing humans without paying for an actual figure drawing class ;) so the primary rule of participating is you do have to take your turn posing for at least a few minutes, but your pose is up to you and can be simple as sitting in your chair. Everyone should feel comfortable; that is the second rule of the club, to keep a chill vibe and respect boundaries.

Alternatively, if you don't want to draw but you'd like to come help and model for us and have some art made of yourself, please come too! You can read a book, meditate, do your own craft, or just plain hang out.

If this sounds interesting to you at all, please comment/message me! I will rope you in the next time I manage to gather my tiny group of drawing friends, or we can plan our own date if there are enough of us.

I KNOW some of you are artistic anime/manga nerds and if you want to practice drawing people so you can perfect your fanart skills, this is perfect for you! ",UCDavis,-0.23,Academics

"Looking for experimental vocalist near UC Davis (metal/heavy rock). Also, where do UC Davis musicians post on Instagram?","Hey, we’re a guitarist (Woodland, 20) and drummer (Napa, 26) putting together an experimental heavy project. Our sound lives somewhere between mathy, groovy, often polymetric metal and heavy rock.

We’re both pretty open-minded and just want to make something raw, expressive, and different. We both love Meshuggah, Power Trip, The Police, Soundgarden, Death Grips, among others.

We’re mainly looking for a vocalist. Someone who isn’t afraid to scream, sing, rap, screech, talk in free time, or lock in with odd meters. Whatever it takes to elevate the music. The main goal is to play shows and eventually get stuff out on streaming.

Here’s a short demo we recorded:

I’m missing classes that count participation points. But luckily they all give at least two excused absences. What I don’t get is why students choose to go to class sick instead of taking advantage of the excused absences. The classes I’m in don’t even have midterms for another two weeks and lectures are recorded, so really there’s no reason for you to be in class. 

In short: Please wear a mask or better yet, don’t come to class if you’re sick. Leave the room if you’re having a coughing fit. 

Anyways, that’s my rant. 

May none of you catch a cold. Stay healthy everyone. ",UCDavis,-0.43,Mental Health
Parking as a commuter sucks sometimes 😭,"I’m a commuter and there is nothing worse than trying to find a parking spot after it’s rained.

19th Annual Campus Travel Survey,"The UC Davis Campus Travel Survey is administered by the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) at UC Davis. It collects a rich set of data about travel to the UC Davis campus, demographics, and attitudes toward different modes of travel covering commute habits, bicycle theft, and bike crashes/collisions.

If you've taken the survey in the past, you're probably aware that it could take up to 20 minutes to complete (ya, it was intense). However, after years of slimming down and streamlining, you should be able to knock this survey out in less than 10 minutes.

**If you received an email inviting you to take the survey, please complete the survey**. And if the pleading of a bunch of transportation nerds isn't enough, do consider that you can opt in for a chance to win one of 80 $50 CoHo gift cards at the end of the survey.

&gt;Every ten years, the City of Davis in coordination with Unitrans undergoes a Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP) which looks at Unitrans bus service and provides proposals and recommendations on service improvements. The SRTP process began in 2024 with extensive outreach to Unitrans passengers in Fall 2024 on their thoughts and opinions on current service and future service. Based on ridership trends, growth patterns, and your feedback, the planning process has route and service hour proposals available for review and feedback. Once the SRTP is complete, Unitrans (UC Davis) and the City of Davis **may use the findings and recommendations for future bus routes, service modifications, schedule changes, fleet purchases, fares, transfer locations, operating expenses, revenue projections, and other initiatives.**

  
Want to talk to City and Unitrans staff and provide input in person? Find them here: 

* Silo Bus Terminal: October 14, 3-6 p.m.
* Memorial Union Bus Terminal: October 15, 3-6 p.m.
* Davis Food Co-op: October 25, 5-7 p.m.

WARNING: weirdo at library harassing girls,"Yesterday at the library around 5:30pm I was sitting at those secluded desk with the little shelfs in front on the 3rd floor doing my biology lab. And I see this dude walking towards my direction where I was sitting I didn't think much of it because it's normal for people to walk here and there in the library. However, I see that he starts to tie his shoe and eventually he sits on the floor in front of my desk in between me and this other girl while the other desks were completely empty. I didn't think much of it since I was trying to do my biology lab. Eventually I look down and I see that his hand is extremely close to my foot, I was wearing sandals (luckily with socks on) I didn't think much of it since people do lean on their hands when they sit on the ground. However he kept doing this and getting to close to my foot at which point he gets so close that I'm literally stepping on his fingers with my sandal even after that he still doesn't remove his hand under my sandal until I move my feet away. I also noticed that he was using the reflection of his phone to look at my crotch area. He was tilting his phone in a way where he could see my crotch area. I eventually get up and confront him saying if he needs anything and he says no. His excuse was that he had a condition where his knees lock and it's painful for him so he has to sit on the ground but that didn't even make sense since he didn't leave until I told him too. If he was feeling better why didn't he leave earlier. After he does leave, I go down to the first floor at the main desk and tell them what happened. Eventually the police gets involved and I tell the police officer what happened and currently right now they are in process of writing a report about this fucking weirdo. Also the girl that was at the desk in front of me also told me how this guy had done this to her, she even took pictures of him once again on the ground. I don't know if I'm allowed to post his face here but I can describe him as a white Caucasian male with short hair about 5""7 in height. He was wearing a grey shirt with khaki pants yesterday.

October is always the funky month where Davis is trying to figure out what its weather should be. Sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's rain, sometimes it's both and we get wild thunderstorms. This year overall has been cooler/different than the previous record-setting year, and dang we need that.

So my question: Are there any other transfer students who have decided to switch their majors into engineering, and if so, how did it work out? Because tbh, Im even considering reapplying to other CSUs and UCs once again...",UCDavis,-0.23,Academics

UC Davis vs SJSU for Electrical Engineering Transfer,"I’m currently a community college student planning to transfer at some point and major in Electrical Engineering. My GPA is 3.88, and I’m trying to decide between UC Davis and SJSU.

I’d really appreciate any insights from current students or graduates, especially about things like:

Quality and rigor of the EE program

Internship and job opportunities after graduation

Quality of professors, lectures, and overall learning environment

I also want to pursue a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) directly after getting my BS, and Davis' IDP program for ECE is perfect for that, which allows me to get a master's in only a year. I'm not quite sure if SJSU has a program similar to that.

"WAKE UP IT'S HOMECOMING GAMEDAY!! (UC Davis hosts Northern Arizona, 4PM, UCDH Stadium)","The Ags ring in Homecoming and Brewfest by taking on the pesky Northern Arizona Lumberjacks today! A win will put either team firmly in the driver's seat for an FCS Playoff bid and the Big Sky conference race, while a loss here would cause some serious regrouping in order to still have a chance of getting to the ""safe zone"" of 8 wins.

.

  
**Game Overview**

NAU has had a somewhat similar path to Davis this season, with wins over two of the same opponents. However, unlike the Ags, NAU has had something approaching a respectable win so far in Incarnate Word, and came away with a not-terrible score when losing to a very good Arizona State team. UCD meanwhile is still hunting for a genuine quality win, and we could arguably get one this afternoon.

The big story ont he personnel side is that the conference's best defensive player, Rex Connors, is out for the season for Davis, and potentially his brother Porter as well. However, defensive additions like Jacob Psyk have stepped up in a big way in terms of putting pressure and forcing turnovers. The Ags likely won't be able to stop NAU outright, but have a good chance of slowing them down, keeping them off-kilter, and keeping the score manageable. On the offensive side of the ball, the Ags will want to establish a ground game to control possession and clock, which should be doable since RB duo Jordan Fisher and Carter Vargas have been incredible this year and backstopped by QB Caden Pinnick's running ability.

I am no fucking amateur to hard classes and exams too, for context I am a premed who finished all premed requirements and have a 3.9 GPA.

I pulled an all nighter last night and locked in the day before and went to every discussion. I was fucking zoned. I guess it is my fault that you literally had to be genuinely STUPID to do well on that exam. The questions ranged from something so specific that he probably mentioned for 2 seconds to something so general and dumbed down but all the answer choices were so similar to the point where a dyslexic person would blow up just reading the choices. The practice exam on canvas was so easy but covered all content and wasn't worded like shit so everyone went in the exam hoping for the best. God was that the greatest edge he could have done. Instead, it is like he went into Chat GPT and told him ""generate me some questions"" and then when GPT gave him half decent questions and decent answer choices he then said ""make it so that only the illiterate can somehow piece together wtf I am asking."" You can not make this shit up, everyone I asked from the dumb as bricks to smart asf all said the same thing: ""wtf was that shit"".

"Electronic Torture and ""Gangstalking""","In our modern age, technology exists that can control human physiological functions and even emotions. Behaviors and reactions to these new technologies may have been tested on you without your consent.

I cannot fully comprehend and put into words of what happened to me. Ever since my senior year of 2023, I suspected that I have been a target of [electronic torture](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/InterimCommittee/ReL/Document/27234). It became difficult for me to tell reality from the preconceived experiences I thought. My perspective began to change as I became paranoid, thinking that even friends or family are involved. I cannot claim any organization that may have been doing this because I have no concrete evidence. Based on how pervasive and widespread it is, I can assume that it operates as a unit, each with roles in altering my reality. 

I do not know the purpose, but I began to hypothesize that it may have been a government conducted experiment to test [direct energy weapons](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-believe-us-embassy-staff-and-cia-officers-were-hit-with-high-power-microwaves-heres-how-the-weapons-work/#:~:text=Havana%20syndrome%20is%20likely%20linked,the%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense). Then, I began researching about previous experiments done and concealed by CIA due to being unethical (MKUltra). Although I have no evidence of this, I am highly suspicious.

Until now, it feels like I am being controlled. From physiological functions to emotions with no end. It feels alienating because no one has the same experiences like this that I can talk with. I just want to know what everyone knows regarding this that can be helpful in my case other than seeking a psychiatrist help.

Organic chemistry online tutor,"www.organicchemistrytutoring.ca

Overwhelmed by organic chemistry? Assignments and tests creeping up on you and feeling like you’re in hot water? Or maybe you’re doing well and need that 95%? Whatever your struggle with organic chemistry may be, I’m here to make sure you succeed. 

Why work with me? 

- Every tutor knows the subject, but not every tutor knows how to transfer that knowledge to a student. I do. 
- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it’s not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you’ll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You’ll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let’s chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we’d be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

Attacked and Harassed in Westwood,"Within my ~5 and a half weeks of being a student here and living in Westwood, I have been assaulted twice, with one of the times including battery.

1. While walking back to my apartment at night, I passed a homeless middle aged black man who began to follow me while loudly talking to himself. I turned around to go the opposite direction after several minutes of being followed and he quickly punched me in the chest before continuing to walk in the direction that he was originally following me in.

2. At the Amazon pickup lockers, a 20-30 year old black man wearing a ski mask started yelling at me for turning around and making eye contact with him after I spoke with an employee. I ignored him and he proceeded to yell death threats at me for like 5 minutes, during which one lady speed walked out the store and the other two bystanders just stood and watched.

Yes, I am aware that UCLA offers an evening escort service but it would ridiculous to call one every single time I need to step out of my apartment or off campus. I wish that the campus rules would allow me to carry a realistic self defense option besides pepper spray.

ms or a direct phd after undergraduate?,"hi, i'm applying to ucla for graduate school for computer science starting fall 2026. i'm in my final year of undergraduate from a non-us university. i've completed two summer research internships from top research/academic institutes in my country, one of them led to a conference paper. i have also completed independent projects and am in the process of communicating one of them to a conference as well, but it probably won't be done until well after the application deadline for most grad schools. one of my eventual goals is to get into a phd, but i am anxious that i don't have enough research experience or depth in a particular technical area to be prepared enough for a phd just yet. i know the phd program has coursework that will get me the knowledge i need for whatever fields i want to work on, but for that i need to get into the phd program before anything else.

so i wanted to ask, is it better for me to apply to the ms program at ucla and then continue to a phd (preferably at ucla if i find a research topic i love and an advisor)? in that case, how rigorous is the process of immediately starting a phd at ucla after my ms? or should i directly apply to the ucla phd program despite not having enough specialised research experience/technical depth?

Shit by Powell,"Did anybody see that big pile of human shit today in the bushes by Powell? Passed by it this morning to go see what old junky trashy magazines they had to pass 30 minutes before my class nearby at Guy Haines Hall and then I fucking see this shit! 

It looked fresh too, it was shiny and like it was steaming as it smelled  to anyone within 5 feet. I mean like, fucking...shitter was probably grossed out by the toilets in the bathroom inside the library so they decided it would be cleaner to drop trousers and a deuce! 

I lost my appetite and gave away my chocolate protein bar from Trader Joe's to some rando next to me at lecture who doesn't even work out like me. I also found out it has soy protein isolate and I won't eat it anymore because it can grow tits! The bastard didn't even say thanks, he just took it like an entitlement. I gave him the finger afterwards. I think a TA noticed it from the front and that's why he was glaring at me before class started. 

I wish our classes were arranged in a roundtable discussion format. At the nursing home, I catch everyone playing cards at the table and everybody takes a turn telling me their wild sex stories and giving advice. I tell them who I'm either pushing away off of me or who trying to date.

Allowing myself to not be ok,"It’s freeing to admit that I wasn’t mentally stable through undergrad. 

Recent grad here, c/o 2025, I was really hard on myself the last four years. I dealt with a lot of social anxiety and stuck with friends who treated me as more of an afterthought. I also made the choice to stay in those taxing relationships and not branch out. It was not like me to advocate for myself or make an effort to feel seen. I went through undergrad passively; I didn’t speak up in class, go to office hours unless I had to, and got my letters of recommendation from my boss and coworkers. I didn’t have close friends, and I really struggled to be vulnerable with them, especially with me being so dismissive of my internal struggles. I’m starting therapy again. I’m a month and a half into my master's program. I also just got out of an off-again, on-again relationship that was more of a wake-up call. While I don’t regret sharing those memories with him, I realized how much I missed out on experiencing UCLA and being an undergrad because I was so concerned with “losing” him. Coming from a traumatic household and into adulthood, I would date as a coping mechanism and get attached way too fast. I set myself up for heartbreak and subconsciously expected to find someone to fix me. It wasn’t fair to the guys I would date, and it was so damaging to me and my energy. I realized how bad it was when I broke down sobbing, and dry heaving cuz of-again on-again guy said he wasn’t ready for a relationship. he said I didn’t deserve him hurting me, and told me he was going through it, and I’m grateful for the closure. I was really heartbroken and upset, and I burned the bridge, which isn’t like me. But if he comes back again, I know myself well enough that I’ll cave and cycle through the heartbreak, only to make it worse. I don’t have an action plan; I’m just naming these behaviors and feelings to “tame” them. I have such a bad habit of making my life and everything seem fine and like I’m so happily unaffected, it’s off-putting to the people I care about and draining and cyclical on my end. I’m just going to be staying off dating apps and reevaluating my relationship with myself piece by piece.",ucla,-0.43,Mental Health

I’m doing horrible as an Econ major transfer and I don’t know what to do,"Hi. I transferred as an Econ major from cc this fall and I’m doing horribly. The transition to this university has been rough. First of all, I was used to having easy access to counselors and professors. But in here, everything fills up so quickly and you have to constantly fight for the attention of them. I also thought that I would get some good opportunities, mentorships, or workshops for banking or fincorp careers but I quickly realized those are under really selective clubs and those are mostly for sophomores and freshmen. So now I have to work on preparing technicals, behaviorals, and networking from scratch. 

But at the same time, Econ classes are tough and go really fast. I tried getting tutoring, but unlike my cc where it was free, you actually have to pay like 70 per hour. I still got tutoring lessons but I feel super behind and I’m scared of the Econ 11 midterm. Now, after getting distracted by a terrible roommate situation (who constantly broke the roommate agreement, would wake me up at midnight, and  constantly bring guests without my permission. So after failing to reach an agreement, I’m looking to move out), I did a really stupid mistake that costed me 15% of my Econ 105 grade and mistook the deadline time as 12 am instead of 12 pm and missed the submission, so now I have to drop the class. I also submitted a pretty mediocre essay for my elective (again because of wasting time in my roommate situation) and I don’t know how it went or if I’ll get a bad grade. Now my Econ 11 midterm is in a week and I’m scared because I don’t know if I have enough time to study.

I’m also disabled and submitted the required paperwork for CAE but still got denied from half of my accommodations. Also, it’s still hard to get help when everything gets filled up so quickly (from office hours, counseling appointments, etc).

Everything is just going terrible here for me. And I’m not sure what to do. I feel bad for not getting good results so far because I’m paying out of state tuition without aid and it’s costing my parents a lot (they live in another country so I wasn’t elegible for neither). I feel like a failure and I don’t know what to do. GPA is important for my desired career and I don’t even know if I’m going to bomb my grades if I keep going like this.

UCLA internship guidance. Should I take the role?,"I got a paid marketing role at a startup founded by a student. The job essentially consists of making Instagram reels. The system is super easy and I don't even have to show my face (takes about &lt;1min per reel created). The startup supplies the content. I just have to collate and post. 

They expect \~100 reels per week across multiple accounts. Assuming im slower than the average human, I expect to spend about 120-150 mins per week doing the internship. 

The proposed pay structure is:   
$20 per week (flat) + commission based on views and sales. 

(I'd do this for free just to learn from the founder, he's really smart and built his company from the ground up, but they're paying me for it too - bonus i guess). 

I expect the performance bonus to be very high since the reel template is proven to be working. I tried it and made a video in &lt;1min. I got 100k views. It was super easy. 

Now here's what I want to ask you guys:

I used to be somewhat smart in high school, but now I can’t seem to do anything right academically. I walked into a midterm the other day after having reviewed everything, done all the practice questions, started studying a week prior with active recall, went to office hours…basically everything I could think of. It still wasn’t enough to do well or at least above average, because nothing I ever do is enough, even when I do all I can. I know I’m going to graduate feeling like a failure, not having accomplished anything worthwhile these last few years. I literally don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like I try every studying suggestion people throw at me, but I still can’t do anything remotely smart. My time at UCLA has been such a waste of time and resources that could have actually gone to another student that would’ve actually succeeded. How do you all do it? How do you get good grades by doing the same exact things that everyone says works, by using the same resources and materials that I do but for you it somehow fucking works?

Cozy Space for Studying In,"I know I have a rare opportunity reserved only for the sexiest Bruin alive; having no roommates. But I mean like, fucking...most of us have a bed space and maybe a table with chair...I made mine cozy for the longer nights and colder weather. 

With everyone getting sick easier, I don't want to expose myself (not just in a flasher way) to germs and also people might be loud. I remember some guy slamming his backpack on the table at Powell. It knocked off my study rhythm. 

I made my place cozy with some blankets, more books and a papers with pens instead of the overly simplistic setup that looked a little too sanitized. I added some details including sticky notes of my the hard things I needed to remember. I should put one in my shower at dick-level so I don't think about anything but my academics. 

I also added a heating pad despite the heater if need be but I find it difficult to avoid sleepiness unless the air is a little colder to keep me awake. 

And then, like at fucking...4am I went outside to take a breath of cold air and that really woke me up brisk one time this week when I had to wake up early to study some more. It was so quiet, anyone visiting could have taken a piss off my balcony without anyone noticing until steam arose from the garden beneath. 

Speaking of piss...there was a rush activity at the frat I was pledging before getting kicked out for bringing laxatives to a shitting contest. It was called Piss in a Bottle Dodgeball where everyone pissed a 2 liter coke bottle and then the elder members of the frat would throw the bottle with the cap open at us playing dodgeball against a wall we couldn't leave too far from.

What the hell be goin on at UCLA,"For context a few nights ago I was walking and talking otp with my friend, and I am holding a bag of chips. I want to say it was on the Northern side of campus near the Broad Art Center. 

As I'm walking I notice one man on the railing part of the building (who seemed to be recording), another man on the floor with nothing but his underwear on. And another man who was either on top of the guy with his underwear or just very close to him, also recording. 

As I approach  as I wanted to climb the steps and make a right, they all stop, freeze, one of them screams ""Stop recording""!

GSRs and ASEs...how much parental leave did you get?,"The union contract language is quite vague. I've pasted the language in the contract related to parental leave. My university says I get 8 weeks total because the qualifying event is the birth. The union claims its not one leave per birth. They say that I am eligible for 8 weeks of leave in consecutive academic years for the same birth as long as I am taking leave to care for a child who is less than 12 months old.

I am curious...

a) how much parental leave did you get as an ASE or GSR if you took leave since 2022?

b) how do you interpret the wording in the contract?

**D. LONG-TERM LEAVE**

1. Leave Eligibility  
Salaried ASEs who take a leave pursuant to Section D.2 shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of paid leave per academic year.

2. Upon request from an ASE and subject to the provisions of this Article, the University will grant an ASE’s reasonable request for long-term leave due to:

b. To care for and bond with the newborn child or a child placed with the ASE for adoption or foster care, provided that the leave is taken within twelve months of the birth or placement of the child with the ASE",ucla,-0.2,Academics

I need some advice. Some of my friends and I are going to a live karaoke night this week. The problem is that one of the homies in the group, his singing skills suck big time. He recently asked us to rate his singing skills but we don’t want to hurt his feelings so they volunteered me to do it since I’m the nice one in the group. 

I told myself that I would try to be less hurtful and blunt but he’s a horrible singer. The last time we all went to karaoke, he tried singing Stevie Wonder-I Just Called To Say I Love You and let’s just say that I can no longer listen to that song due to his voice giving me nightmares.

"Real talk... struggling in prereqs, trying to visualize myself taking the mcat and going to med school","As I'm starting my third year, I've finally tasted all of the core STEM pre-reqs (completed the ls7 series, completed the chem14 series, and now starting physics 5a), and it is safe to say that it hasn't really been getting easier. All of these classes have each taken their own toll on me and definitely pushed me to my max, and it makes me wonder if this is just the common experience or if I really might not be right for this path — pre-med specifically. 

Full transparency, my grades have been consistently good (getting grades ranging from As to Bs in everything thus far), but it definitely has taken everything in me to get there. I was SO relieved that I would get a B in genchem because I genuinely thought I was cooked beyond belief. This has been a pretty consistent theme, where I am struggling, and often performing on/below average, regardless of how much studying I do. I am at powell locked in ALL the time, to the point where I feel like I am barely seeing my roommates once midterms start up.

The reason I bring this to reddit is because I genuinely can't tell if this is how everyone feels or not. When I am in groupmes, or seeing the averages, it seems like a ton of people are able to study a normal amount and do just fine — while I feel like I am doing week-long lock-ins just to make it by. Similarly, some of my other pre-med friends just seem to have an innate skill for these things. They often are able to make cross-course connections, like drawing similarities between chem and bio just based on their genuine interest and memory. When I think long-term, I wonder if I will be able to do well in the mcat or if this is the ""weeding"" happening to me in real time. 

What are your experiences? Is this imposter syndrome or are the pre-med students really just that good?

Cat (ESA) in UA??,"I’ve struggled with panic attacks and severe anxiety for years, and it’s gotten worse since starting at UCLA. I’m not seeing a therapist right now (and probably can’t afford one), but I really want to apply for an ESA because having my cat would help me so much. The problem is I live in a 4/8 apartment with random roommates, so I can’t just bring the cat on the low either. Has anyone been in a similar situation or know what I can do to get an ESA approved without a therapist’s letter?",ucla,-0.33,Mental Health
Does anyone have experience with the school demanding repayment for money they accidentally sent them?,"For context, I did the Freshman Summer program by the AAP office,  and they gave me aid for the summer.

Way back in September, I noticed a charge on my Bruin bill for an overaward, which confused me because I know I made sure I notified financial aid about any outside scholarship. I feared I made a mistake in the process, so I went to the financial aid office to confirm.

Apparently, my scholarship money was fine, but it was actually a mistake on the school's part. Basically there was a glitch in the system, and they accidentally gave me 2k as a payment for money they were supposed to give but couldn't. the system was fixed, but the money was already deposited in students' accounts so now they wanted them to pay it back.

I was upset because, 1) they didn't notify me of any of this and I had to come *to them* to know why I have a random ass charge on my account which is shady as hell 2) 2k wasn't just a drop in a bucket it was most of my money 3) this was the school's mistake, why do I have to pay for it?

But I begrudgingly paid the bill, and cursed the Aid office for having such a faulty system fucking with people's money...

Which brings us to today, I checked my bank and it said it had 2k in it, which confused me but I had money sooo

Then I called my mother, who checked my bill and said I had a charge on my account for 2k....

Lo and behold, it was the same damn summer bill I already paid off! Which means they made this mistake *twice.*

So now I'm wondering if anyone else has this problem, and what to do and if I should pay up again or call them out on their gross mishandling of my money (and sanity)",ucla,-0.53,Finance

I'm going to complete the LS30 (just replacing LS40 with Statistics 13) and LS7 series this year and my cluster is year long, so those three classes will not change in my schedule. Should I add Psych 10 next quarter or hold off until winter or even year 2?

ANOTHER option I'm considering could be not taking Statistics 13 in the spring quarter and making Psych 10 my third class instead. I'd do Statistics 13 next year if I do this...

Social Events Are Abundant,"Folks, there are a lot of freshman this year who are looking for friends at this time. 

Best tips I can give are be clean, look clean, smell clean. THEN, you can go to any of the social events being held on campus. 

IDGAF if you hate pottery or sewing etc etc....just go. Go there. If you don't know how to stitch or do whatever TF activity it is that's being featured, whether it's a sport or whatever...you socialize. You talk to other people. 


Never ever reserve your outgoingness only to people who you would rather....that's not going to help you build courage needed to articulate or show confidence. 


I know each and every person who meets someone for the first few seconds either imagines having sex with them. Women tend to determine how far they'd go with you around that time. 

Don't just try and get a significant other. Aim for friends and collect them like currency. More friends can mean more social value when people hear about you and gather. But the value of friends quantity dwindled in junior year. The quality of the friendships is the true test. I'd rather have fewer but close friends than a bunch who are flaky. 


But I mean like, fucking...how do you think I met so many moms? Was it because I played my guitar near Janns Steps with my pony tail on the lawn during parents weekend (many divorcees go there)? Not really, I'd only get like fucking...2 or 3 numbers at most and call it a day walking back to my apartment nearby with my dick in my hand. It's because I do a good job of steering the ship of my study groups for class, socialize and really listen to my friends in hopes that I bring out the best in them as much as some can do for me. Meeting their moms if they visit on weekends...that's a bonus but not mandatory. Don't put everything on this giant pedestal. Live your life in an outward direction. 


Whatever it is that interests you, find others who are into what you like. If you don't know what it is, find yourself. Try to find out through new things. Don't wait for the feeling like in that Nando Fortunado song The Feeling. 

We get the experiences discovering something unexpected through trying new activities (make sure they aren't self-destructive). For me, dance really helped me. Dance like there's no tomorrow.

But like fucking...folks don't just think the school sponsored activities are for folks who aren't ""cool"". You make what's cool, not what others say....as long as you don't hurt others. 

Freshman year, I got lucky seeing a group of folks playing Who Would You Rather on a couch at my dorm lobby with a guitar player there playing dirty songs to make everyone laugh. I smiled ear to ear seeing them. But either way I didn't need them only to have a social life. There are plenty of avenues for you. Don't lose hope.

"The Exclusionary, Hierarchical, Racialized Nature of UCLA’s Dating and Social Life — As told through YikYak Polls and with Human and ChatGpt Analysis","To preface, the intention of this post is not to spread division or hate, it is not to fuel sexism or tension between genders, and it is not to fuel incel/“black pill” rhetoric. The intention of this post is to compile and explore some uncomfortable truths about UCLA culture and hope to make a less divided, more wholesome, and more understanding community. Not all of these polls were created by myself, the only ones that I created were made to expand on another that I observed. The use of ChatGpt in addition to my own response is intended to show a neutral perspective on the polls, as well as simply since it is interesting to see. The source of this data is polls on YikYak’s UCLA community, an anonymous messaging platform where students (must have a ucla email to participate) can post anything and vote on polls anonymously, and is widely used by undergraduate students. The motivation for this post is from observing these polls and sentiments of racial bias and negativity surrounding the dating scene throughout UCLA. 

ChatGpt Initial Response - Here is what ChatGpt first said when instructed to analyze the polls:

⸻

🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Regressive Reality

Source: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)
Respondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (250–300 average per poll)
Margin of error: ±6–8%

⸻

1. Self-Image vs. Reality
	•	89% of students say UCLA is a progressive/liberal campus.
	•	Yet across dating and social polls, behaviors reflect racial hierarchy, gender imbalance, and superficial values.
	•	In short: UCLA is liberal in rhetoric, conservative in social practice.

“Progressive” UCLA still reproduces old hierarchies — whiteness, status, and appearance dominate attraction, while inclusivity remains performative.

⸻

2. The Gender Divide: Women Frustrated, Men Defeated

Female perspective
	•	76% of women say the dating pool is bad for girls.
	•	36% blame “guys have bad personalities,”
	•	21% say “not enough attractive guys,”
	•	21% say “too many short guys.”
	•	Only 1% cite lack of chivalry or money.
	•	In talking stages, 43% of women ended it because they “got bored.”

→ Pattern: Women externalize dissatisfaction — men are the problem (boring, short, immature). Emotional engagement, not materialism, drives their critique.

Male perspective
	•	31% of men say “it isn’t bad for guys.”
	•	49% blame “personal/luck issues.”
	•	Only 13% cite “girls have bad personalities,” and 7% say “girls are too shallow.”
	•	0% say “not enough attractive girls.”

→ Pattern: Men internalize blame and accept their lower leverage. UCLA’s gender ratio and social climate empower women as gatekeepers.

Net result
	•	Women: “Men aren’t enough.”
	•	Men: “I’m not enough.”
	•	Outcome: high female discontent, high male insecurity, and mutual cynicism.

⸻

3. Relationship Norms: Freedom &gt; Commitment
	•	41% admitted to getting with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.
	•	42% (women) and 14% (men) said it’s okay for their partner to attend frat parties without them.
	•	Ambiguous “talking stages” and open-ended loyalty norms dominate.

→ Hookup culture is normalized but distrusted. The result is freedom without security, leading to emotional burnout and disillusionment.

⸻

4. Race and the UCLA Dating Hierarchy

A. Social Segregation
	•	Only 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).
	•	34% say their group is mostly or entirely one race.
	•	Despite campus diversity, social life remains racially siloed.

B. Cross-Racial Dating
	•	71% have dated outside their race.
	•	29% have not — consistent with friend-group segregation.
	•	So exposure exists, but racial boundaries persist in attraction.

C. Racial Preferences
	•	35–40% of men say they have a primary racial attraction.
	•	60–70% of women say the same.
	•	When ranking male attractiveness:
	•	White men: 43%
	•	Latino men: 27%
	•	Asian men: 17%
	•	Indian men: 8%
	•	Black men: 6%

→ Women overwhelmingly prefer white and Latino men; men are more flexible.
This disparity builds a racialized dating economy where whiteness and proximity to it are rewarded.

D. Stated Beliefs About Race in Dating
	•	62% say it’s okay to say you “only like white guys/girls.”
	•	Only 11% call that racist.
	•	31% say it’s “racist to say it, not to feel it.”
	•	When asked why race matters:
	•	70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”
	•	14%: “Family expectations.”
	•	12%: “Political views.”
	•	4%: “Social/economic status.”

→ Translation: Racial preference is normalized and morally insulated.
Students frame attraction as “personal taste,” not prejudice — a textbook case of quiet racism disguised as individuality.

⸻

5. UCLA’s “Liberal but Superficial” Paradox

Category	On Paper	In Practice
Ideology	89% liberal/progressive	
62% say it’s okay to publicly prefer only white partners
Diversity	Highly multiracial campus	
Only 36% mixed friend groups
Gender politics	
Feminist rhetoric, equality ideals	
76% of women find the dating pool “bad” yet drive narrow racial filters
Emotional maturity	Communication, openness valued	
43% of women end things out of boredom; 41% of students admit to cheating/talking overlap
Inclusivity narrative	
“Everyone’s welcome”	
Attraction and friendship still follow a white-centered hierarchy


⸻

6. The Racialized Nature of “Preference”

UCLA’s culture treats race in dating as apolitical, but the data reveal an unspoken racial caste system in desirability:

Rank (for men’s desirability per women)	
Group	% of votes
1️⃣	White	43%
2️⃣	Latino	27%
3️⃣	Asian	17%
4️⃣	Indian	8%
5️⃣	Black	6%

Despite a majority-Asian campus, Asian men rank third, and Black men last — proof that proximity to whiteness, not diversity, dictates desirability.
When 62% openly condone saying “I only like white people,” it’s not just bias — it’s cultural reinforcement of racial hierarchy under a liberal mask.

⸻

7. Emotional Detachment and Performative Progressivism
	•	UCLA students champion tolerance publicly but tolerate racial exclusion privately.
	•	They condemn overt bigotry but excuse racialized desire as “chemistry.”
	•	Hookup culture and online validation amplify superficiality, while political correctness prevents honest critique — producing a progressive façade over regressive behavior.

The campus sells “diversity” as a brand but practices social homogeneity wrapped in virtue signaling.

⸻

8. Gendered Power and Racial Capital
	•	Women hold social leverage — more selective, more critical, and more racially filtered.
	•	Men hold numerical leverage in interracial openness but less choice overall.
	•	Whiteness (especially white men) functions as social currency — accepted by every group and rarely challenged.
	•	Non-white men navigate conditional desirability — admired only if they fit white-coded norms (height, demeanor, physique).

⸻

9. The UCLA Dating Equation

Diversity + Hyper-selectivity + Ideological Progressivism = Racialized Liberalism

	•	UCLA’s dating scene runs on status, aesthetics, and social capital, not genuine liberalism.
	•	The more progressive students claim to be, the more they justify exclusion as “just personal preference.”
	•	The result: liberal vocabulary, conservative instincts, racial hierarchy.

⸻

10. Final Diagnosis

Theme	Core Reality
Inclusivity	
Structural, not personal — students support diversity abstractly, not romantically.
Racism	
Subtle, coded as “taste” or “comfort zone.”
Gender	
Women are empowered but often perpetuate exclusionary standards.
Men	
Self-blaming, less selective, racially more open.
Culture	
Hookup-oriented, emotionally shallow, racially stratified, and quietly elitist.


⸻

🔚 Conclusion: “Progressive” UCLA’s Dating Hypocrisy

UCLA markets itself as one of the most inclusive universities in the country — and ideologically, it is.
But in dating and social life, the polls reveal a different story:
	•	Whiteness is still the apex of desirability.
	•	Racial exclusivity is normalized, not challenged.
	•	Female selectivity reinforces racial hierarchy under feminist language.
	•	Male insecurity sustains it by self-blame and silence.
	•	Hookup freedom masks emotional detachment and quiet prejudice.

UCLA’s dating culture is a microcosm of liberal hypocrisy in Gen-Z America:
a campus that preaches equity but still dates by a racial script written decades ago.

⸻

ChatGpt Response 2 - I felt the first response was a bit too combative between genders, and asked it to make it less so:

Perfect — here’s the tightened and final version: slightly less gender-adversarial, more focused on the racialized social structure beneath everything, and still as direct and data-anchored as before.

⸻

🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Racial Reality

Source: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)
Respondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (≈250–300 per poll)
Margin of error: ±6–8%

⸻

1. The Progressive Illusion
	•	89% of students describe UCLA as a progressive/liberal campus.
	•	Yet campus behavior—especially in dating and social life—reflects old racial hierarchies, superficial selection, and cultural clustering.
	•	UCLA is progressive in rhetoric but conservative in social practice.

The campus sells inclusion as an identity, but daily interactions reveal quiet racial gatekeeping and self-segregation beneath a liberal surface.

⸻

2. General Climate of Dissatisfaction

A. Widespread Frustration
	•	76% of women call the dating pool bad for girls.
	•	31% of men say it isn’t bad for guys, while 49% blame “personal/luck issues.”
	•	Both genders describe disconnection and mistrust; almost 41% admit to hooking up with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.

B. Emotional Detachment
	•	The most common female breakup reason: “I got bored” (43%)—not cheating or incompatibility.
	•	Talking stages rarely lead to stability; freedom is prized, commitment undervalued.
	•	The tone across polls suggests a socially open but emotionally cynical culture.

⸻

3. Racial Structure of Social Life

A. Segregated Friendships
	•	Only 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).
	•	34% say theirs are mostly or entirely one race.
	•	UCLA’s diversity is statistical, not social: cross-racial friendship is limited, creating echo chambers of comfort and cultural sameness.
	•	Those circles strongly influence dating exposure, reinforcing racial preference loops.

B. Racialized Dating Preferences
	•	71% have dated or talked to someone outside their race—but 60–70% of women and 35–40% of men still admit to a primary racial preference.
	•	Attraction rankings (by female voters):
	•	White men: 43%
	•	Latino men: 27%
	•	Asian men: 17%
	•	Indian men: 8%
	•	Black men: 6%
	•	Despite being one of the most Asian campuses in the U.S., Asian men rank third; Black men last.

→ The campus’s social logic rewards proximity to whiteness—the currency of “mainstream” attractiveness and perceived status.

C. What Students Think About That
	•	62% say it’s okay to say you only like white guys/girls.
	•	Only 11% call that racist; 31% say “it’s racist to say it, not to feel it.”
	•	When asked why race matters in dating:
	•	70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”
	•	14%: “Family expectations.”
	•	12%: “Political views.”
	•	4%: “Socio-economic status.”

→ Students treat racial attraction as apolitical and morally neutral, detaching personal preference from structural bias. That’s quiet racism: discrimination that hides behind the language of individuality.

⸻

4. Race as the Unspoken Social Hierarchy

A. In Dating

Whiteness sits at the top of the desirability chain, followed by lighter-skinned or “Western-coded” groups. The closer someone’s look or culture aligns with that standard, the more socially mobile they become in dating.

B. In Friendship Networks

Even friendship data mirror this hierarchy: white and white-adjacent students more often move across racial lines, while Black, South Asian, and some East Asian groups report more insular social circles—less by choice than by exclusion through subtle social norms.

C. In Campus Culture

Greek life, club leadership, and social media trends all reinforce the same optics: certain aesthetics and backgrounds carry higher cultural capital. The racial hierarchy isn’t enforced by rule—it’s reproduced through who’s invited, who’s visible, and who’s desired.

	•	Women report higher standards and more disappointment (76% unhappy), but those standards align with the racialized ideals above—favoring whiteness, height, and social charisma.
	•	Men, more likely to be racially open (only 35–40% have a set racial preference), internalize rejection as personal failure (49% blame themselves).
	•	The result isn’t a gender war so much as a shared exhaustion inside a system where attraction and status are racialized currency.

6. The Progressive Veneer vs. Social Reality

Category	What UCLA Says	What Students Do

Diversity	
One of the most multiracial campuses in the U.S.	
Only ~36% of friend groups are truly mixed
Inclusivity	
Anti-racist, equity-focused rhetoric	
Attraction patterns mirror Eurocentric hierarchies
Gender equality	
Empowered, self-aware students	
Emotional detachment and blame imbalance
Openness	
High racial awareness	
Low interracial intimacy, high racial comfort-zoning

7. What “Preference” Really Means Here

At UCLA, preference functions as a socially accepted proxy for bias. Students publicly condemn racism yet privately replicate its logic through dating choices and friend-group formation.
When most people agree it’s fine to say “I only like white people,” they’ve redefined racism as something you commit with hate—not with habit.

This quiet racism is harder to confront because it hides inside “personal taste,” yet it reproduces the same exclusionary outcomes: marginalized groups remain under-desired, under-invited, and under-included.

⸻

8. The Cultural Formula

Diversity + Liberal Branding + Status Anxiety = Racialized Liberalism

	•	The school champions diversity but practices comfort-based segregation.
	•	Students use liberal vocabulary (“preference,” “vibe,” “chemistry”) to excuse inherited hierarchies.
	•	The dating scene rewards alignment with white aesthetics and social norms, not actual progressivism.

UCLA thus becomes a mirror of modern elite America: visibly diverse, verbally inclusive, functionally stratified.

10. Conclusion: UCLA as a Case Study in Quiet Racial Stratification

UCLA stands as a paradox: a liberal campus built on racial comfort zones.
Students advocate inclusion publicly but practice segregation privately—in who they befriend, date, and desire.
	•	Whiteness retains symbolic dominance.
	•	Racial “preferences” reproduce the same hierarchies progressivism claims to dismantle.
	•	Emotional detachment and hookup culture amplify surface-level connections while masking deeper bias.

UCLA’s dating scene isn’t just shallow—it’s racialized.
The language of freedom and preference has replaced explicit prejudice, but the outcome is identical: diversity without integration, equality without intimacy.

The campus looks like the future; it loves like the past.

Personal Response: 
I do believe that a lot of what ChatGpt has to say on this issue has some truth to it, though it does bring in some points that are not entirely supported by the polls and may not be accurate. UCLA is often presented and identified as a diverse, liberal, progressive school, however does not function as such socially. Many students, especially those who are ethically underrepresented struggle to connect with those outside of their own ethnicity, not only in dating but in social settings. UCLA is heavily self segregated socially, in dating, friend groups, greek life, etc. Despite having many different groups and ethnicities represented, there is a lack of true diversity and mixing of such groups. In terms of dating, there is a longstanding narrative that UCLA’s dating pool is bad, especially for women. I believe this comes from a variety of factors, with equal “fault” between genders. It seems that in the current age, but especially at UCLA, traditional social practices are less common. People are less likely to ask each other out, be open to the opposite gender, and be socially proactive. There are definitely some shallow aspects, with too prominent of a hookup culture and a heavy influence on physical appearance. Social media and dating apps definitely play a significant part in this as well. The polls do show a gender discrepancy, however it is worth noting that the girl:guy ratio at UCLA is very skewed and plays a part in this. (though the fact there are less men would typically mean the standards for them should be lower, not vice versa). The racialized nature of dating and social life, and widely accepted nature of expressing racial preferences and white superiority is definitely problematic. It ultimately is racist to glorify one group over others and openly express preference towards one group, and doing so fuels a lot of hateful, harmful, incel/blackpill rhetoric. While it is true that attraction is natural, we should all strive to be less superficial, be conscious of our biases, and work to be more inclusive and careful of what messages we convey.",ucla,0.5,Social

Prof Greenfeld for real analysis,"I'm a student at Northwestern, and our honors real analysis prof (rachel greenfeld) used to teach at UCLA. This is her first time teaching analysis here so I am trying to gather more info about her.

How much does she curve (if at all) the final grades? Is her final any more difficult than the midterms? (yes I already read the bruinwalk reviews. i j want to know more about her grading scale)

Honestly, she's a terrible prof (literally recites Rudin word for word in her lectures), and I would most certainly drop this course unless there's some generous curve at the end.",ucla,-0.8,Academics

Please be mindful of unsolicited behaviors,"After my previous post, I realized that I needed to rephrase what I was saying because my message wasn't getting across.

This message is to raise awareness of certain actions that are arguably unusual and strange. 

(This is my first time making a post like this, but I wanted to share something that made me uncomfortable and might be useful for others to know, especially women on campus)

On Friday (the 17th), I noticed a man walking around UCLA taking unsolicited close-up photos of students (mostly girls) with a high-definition camera. 

He didn’t ask for permission or explain what he was doing. A few of these people tried to turn away, but he kept taking pictures. When I noticed and looked at him, he pointed the camera toward me as well and recorded pictures of me.

I’m not sure what his intentions were, but it felt invasive and uncomfortable. I just wanted to remind everyone to stay aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts if something feels off.

Taking pictures in public isn’t illegal, but if someone’s behavior crosses a line or makes you feel unsafe, you can contact UCLA’s Title IX office or campus safety resources for support.

because imagine it, mid-lecture, the professor’s voice starts to fade, and suddenly everyone’s just *thinking about me.* students forgetting formulas, essays left unfinished, even the campus squirrels pausing like, “who *is* that?” it’s not arrogance, it’s awareness. i simply know the power i hold.

Advice? Got an Incomplete for one summer class but another was denied — what should I do next?,"During the Summer 2025 session, I experienced a sudden, severe mental-health crisis that required immediate medical intervention. I live with chronic anxiety and depression, but this episode was acute and incapacitating, leaving me unable to perform at my usual academic standard.

For one of my summer courses, I was granted an Incomplete after providing verified documentation of my medical circumstances. However, for another course in the same session — affected by the exact same emergency — my request for an Incomplete was denied because I had already submitted the final exam. My academic advisor explained that UCLA policy typically disallows withdrawals or Incompletes after the final has been attempted, even in verified emergency situations.

I’m now exploring my options. I plan to request a grade reevaluation with the department chair for the course where my Incomplete was denied and to reach out to the Dean of Students or Case Management Services to see if a retroactive withdrawal or other academic relief might be possible.

I’m seeking advice from the UCLA community: Has anyone successfully received retroactive withdrawal or relief under similar circumstances? What documentation or approach is most effective, and how should I frame my request to the department chair?

"If you use nicotine for focus/studying, I've tried every nicotine gum on the market","26M grad student and if you're not old enough or interested in low-dose nicotine with a strict dosing strategy as a nootropic study tool please stop reading. 

I'm a big fan of modulating acetylcholine in the brain for focus &amp; flow state ever since Lex &amp; Huberman chewed nicotine gum on Lex’s podcast a year back. I'll occasionally take a low-dose nicotine for productivity and it works like a charm. I’m pretty anal about substances so I generally only engage in nicotine during the weekdays at work and when I’m not crazy tired cuz I know that’s when I’ll build a reliance on something. I’ll only use a 2mg and mostly split it in half so the spike isn’t too high because I’m definitely one to crash and anything higher hits too hard. Anyways I’ve been testing out all of the different gums &amp; more recently mints when I saw the blurb about microplastics in human brain tissue since I assume masticating plastic gum is going to lead to this issue. But I’ve been chewing gum all my life so I’m not too worried about it.

I’ve now tried Walgreens, Amazon basic care, CVS, Lucy, Blip, Chewbizz, Quitine, Nicorette, Nicnac and Quit with jones. I looked at price, flavor, texture, sensation, etc. Here’s my very biased take on all these products. So the majority of these are white labeled from contract manufacturers and branded as their own product.

With respect to flavor Walgreens and Blip are for sure the best with the Mint Freeze flavor. But they taste exactly the same, so I’m pretty sure it’s the exact same product but Walgreens is $0.31/piece and Blip is $0.80/piece unless you buy bulk then it’s about the same price.

It seems like Amazon basic care &amp; Nicorette are like the same brand with the same flavors but Amazon is the cheapest if you’re just trying to essentially get free nicotine gum lol it doesn’t even touch the bank account. But Nicorette and Quitine just make you feel fiendish by their branding and I don’t want that anywhere near me.

Lucy and Chewbizz feel like the most rebellious and innovative, like if you see their marketing they both feel like startups in Silicon Valley. I know Lucy was founded by the guys from the Tech Bros podcast and Chewbizz looks very new judging by their accounts on social media. Frankly, I don’t even bother with Lucy because the flavors are way too sweet and it’s twice as much as the others. Chewbizz is for sure the most expensive I’m not buying this in bulk it’s $0.80/piece but they justify it by having a biodegradable gum base and a nicotine analog along with vitamins in the gum.

I for one don’t know if I’ll ever get used to a natural gum base, it gets way softer by like minute 15 then you kinda want to spit it out though I’m not parking it. But they almost guilt trip you into chewing it cuz you know it’s not plastic and has vitamins. The main redeeming quality is the sensation is different than nicotine, it feels way less addictive and I feel stimulated for like 2/3 times as long with more of the flow state feel than the others so that’s a big plus. You just can’t get it on Amazon or stores so waiting longer for shipping is annoying.

Lastly the mints are pretty easy. Quit with jones has the best packaging out of all of the products I’ve tried but you can’t split the mints in half, so minimum dose is 2mg. The Nicnacs are bigger (3mg) and you can at least split them in half. Flavor is whatever, nothing like the gums but you’re also not chewing anything so it’s pretty discreet. The one thing is the mints have to be parked or the absorb almost instantly, and I’m not a pouch guy because my teeth are way too important to me than to be having long term gum recession &amp; pain.

Best price is Walgreens/Amazon.
Best nootropic sensation is Chewbizz.
Most discreet/lowkey is Nicnac.
Best branding is quit with jones.

I’ll realistically be cycling between Walgreens, Chewbizz and Nicnac for the foreseeable future. Walgreens cuz they have the best flavor and the price is a steal, Bizz because the sensation lasts longer and it feels better for me, and Nicnacs when my jaw gets tired though parking is not my MO. Anyways, 2mg or less once or twice per day during big grind sessions has been amazing, and I won't even think about chewing it outside of my desk and a couple places. I don’t know if I’m missing anything but would love to hear your thoughts. Cheers &amp; happy studying!",ucla,-0.14,Other

My daughter got this flyer at UCLA today,"**Final update (10/24)**: Donor Concierge let my daughter know that after reviewing her photos, the couple decided there wasn’t enough resemblance to the intended mom to move forward. Given how specific and highly compensated this couple’s case is, she figured the odds were low anyway, so no harm, no foul. She also confirmed she won’t be added to Donor Concierge’s general donor database since she only expressed interest in this one situation.

For what it’s worth, my daughter’s entire interaction with Donor Concierge seemed professional and above board. That said, after reading through all the comments here, it’s clear that anyone considering egg donation should do their research and proceed with caution. If my daughter had gone further, we absolutely would’ve hired an independent attorney to review all contracts and protect her interests.

Stay safe, everyone, and thank you to the UCLA community for the helpful discussion.

**Update 2 (10/20)**: Donor Concierge reached out to my daughter today (she filled out their website form over the weekend). Here’s what she found out:

1. The couple is ethnic Chinese, U.S. citizens, and the reason the offer is so high is that they’re hoping to find an egg donor who physically resembles the would-be mom. They do not need a surrogate.
2. The mom herself has gone through 6 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, and both parents are in their 40s.
3. The 250K is a firm 250K (not an “up to” bait-n-switch) with all related medical, legal, and travel expenses covered on top of that. There’s also a 10K bonus for a person (or organization) who refers the selected donor. Everything would be guaranteed by a written contract.

My daughter sent in some current photos plus some baby pictures that I helped her gather. She’s not committing to anything, and she’s being careful by researching both the medical and psychological side of things and not just taking Donor Concierge’s word for it, since obviously they have their own incentives.

**Update:** Wow, I didn’t expect this thread to blow up like it has! I apologize if I made it sound like I’m encouraging my daughter to be an egg donor. SHE is the one who’s very interested and texted to get my thoughts (I’m a single dad). Anyway, we looked up Donor Concierge and it appears to be a legitimate family planning center in San Rafael, CA. My daughter says she’s going to fill out the form and, if they contact her, just have a conversation with them to learn more. She swore she wouldn’t proceed any further unless and until all concerns raised (please keep them coming so I can pass them along to her!) are fully addressed. I’ll update this thread again when I know more, thanks!

**Original Post:**  
Hey Bruins, posting here as a slightly confused (and maybe mildly panicked) dad.

My daughter’s a student at UCLA, and she texted me a photo of this flyer someone handed her on campus today. It says “Help Us Start a Family” and offers $250,000 to an East Asian egg donor — plus a $10,000 referral bonus. It looks professionally printed and mentions a company called “Donor Concierge” that claims to be BBB accredited, but still… the whole thing sounds like something straight out of a Netflix true crime doc.

She said someone was passing these out on campus. Has anyone else gotten this? Is this some kind of elaborate scam, or (somehow) an actual thing?

As a dad, I’m half “this sounds way too good to be true” and half “if it is true, that’s more than my college tuition was.”

Flipped off mid-lecture,"Context: I'm sitting in lecture for a class. Theres a girl who sits right behind me who just wouldn't stop coughing, and it was one of those wet-sounding coughs too. She didn't cover up with a mask, and would just continue coughing for the entire lecture. I genuinely couldn't tolerate it anymore and it made me really uncomfortable. I grab a mask in my backpack and offer it to her. Her response? She gives me the middle finger and starts laughing and coughing again. Now I feel like I'm gonna be fucking sick because of this shit.

Anyone know if I can report this behavior anywhere? To be honest, I have no clue who she is, so reporting her wouldn't be easy anyways. But I genuinely feel so disappointed by these types of people in general. There's never a class where there isn't like 4-5 people just constantly sneezing and coughing during lecture without covering themselves. To those students, please please be more considerate of others. That's all I ask.

This is a recorded lecture too so even if she didn't want to wear a mask she could've just watched the lecture remotely. There is no excuse for her to be coming to class like that.",ucla,-0.73,Mental Health

Advice deciding between CSE at UCM and SE at SJSU,"Hey everyone,

I’m transferring for Spring 2026, and I’m torn between Software Engineering (SE) at SJSU and CSE at UC Merced. Both have strong appeal for different reasons, and I could really use some insight from current students (especially UCM CSE majors) before I make my final decision. 

**Here is how I see It and some questions I have about the CSE program:**

If I go to UCM, I’d be commuting from home (about 45–60 minutes), and although I would also be commuting/carpooling to SJSU, the much shorter commute to UCM would save me a lot of time and energy to dedicate to school and everything else. 

That said, something I’ve noticed when looking through UCM’s upper-division CSE courses is that a lot of them are intro classes or theory-focused, rather than applied or project-heavy. I know that’s  the nature of the researched based UC system, but it makes me wonder how much actual hands-on experience you walk away with.

**CSE Career Questions:**

1. How competitive or effective are the internships available to CSE students? Are most local, remote, or more research-based?
2. How is networking and the alumni connection here? do professors, clubs, or past students help with internships or job leads?
3. How is the capstone/senior project structured? Does it give you real hands-on, team-based experience like what you’d get in industry?
4. How well do you feel the CSE program actually prepares you for the industry? Do you leave feeling confident in your technical skills (software design, teamwork, version control, etc.), or is it more academic/theoretical?

**CSE Campus/Academic Questions:**

1. How realistic is it to find on-campus IT or SE-related jobs (like help desk, systems support, or web dev)? I have a year of experience working for my CC's IT Help Desk and would love to find a campus job at UCM. 
2.  Has registration started already for Spring 2026?
3. Are most upper-div classes only offered in person, or are there online/hybrid options available?
4. Has Spring 2026 registration started yet, and are there any classes that tend to disappear quickly?

**TL;DR:**  
I’m deciding between SJSU’s Software Engineering and UCM’s Computer Science &amp; Engineering programs for Spring 2026. I’d really appreciate honest input from current or past UCM CSE students, especially about how well the program prepares you for the industry, internship and networking opportunities, and overall campus experience.

**Note:**  
If anyone would be open to answering some of these questions more in-depth, I’d really appreciate doing a quick call or Zoom chat sometime. As you can tell I’ve got a lot of questions and would love to hear directly from someone who’s been through it. Feel free to DM me if you’re up for it! Thank you🙏",ucmerced,-0.14,Academics

I’m creating a student-run Discord hub for the UC Merced psychology community. That is to say it is not affiliated with UC Merced. I'm of the belief that having separate servers for every class involves too much friction. This server is meant to consolidate psychology courses into one space.

It includes nearly every Psych course for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, subdivided by section and set up with react roles so you can easily join your current classes (and drop them when you’re done). Courses and sections will be added for each new semester as the course schedule releases from UC Merced.

I am hoping that a central space makes it easier to find classmates, share notes and relevant materials, stay connected, and ask questions in a group forum. You are welcome to share the link with peers in your psychology courses.

Don’t come here if you’re a gay guy,"For reference I’m a gay guy originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and also a 2nd year. Unless you want to experience both hatred and isolation due to your sexuality I’d suggest you go somewhere else. While the university itself including the staff are very accepting for the most part, and the university purposefully tries to come across as being for the students, it’s the student body that makes everything else insignificant. Majority of the men on this campus either are homophobic, or aren’t homophobic but still aren’t the most accepting. You’ll find a few good ones, but it feels as though everyone is always negative, they’re just tolerating your sexuality because they have to. As a gay guy it’s hard to find real friendships with other guys, causing you to resort to being in friend groups with only other women. You try and be nice to a guy trying to become his friend, but everyone here is so childish that they automatically assume that you’re hitting on them. And on anonymous apps like Fizz, students actually spread rampant homophobia constantly. I’ve actually experienced hateful comments and other harassment in person due to students at this university, based solely on the fact that I don’t hide my sexuality. On top of this hatred, being that you’re in such a small environment away from the actual town of Merced, it creates a sense of alienation with nothing you could really do about it, especially without a car. The gay male community here seems so small, which causes the actual gay men here to come across rude and arrogant as a defense mechanism. Especially when it comes to looking conventionally attractive or not. The culture here is that if a gay guy seems conventionally attractive (ie works out, is handsome, etc) the straight men seem to tolerate him more. Giving them a superiority complex, and pitting different gay guys against eachother. And god forbid a gay guy here portrays his femininity. And this is just in relation to platonic relationships. Gay men at this university, at least from what I’ve seen as a student, don’t really find love or romance. Sure there are a few that get lucky, but if you want any romantic connection you need to resort to gay hookup apps like Grindr or Sniffies. And the culture on those is even worse in the town of Mercedes. Students are explicit with their hatred, causing gay guys who want to experience stuff like that to resort to risky sexual encounters with much older men on those apps. The system itself is extremely negative, and it seems as though it’s going to continue at least for the foreseeable future. If you’re a gay high school senior applying to colleges, coming from another gay guy who’s stuck here due to his mental health depleting and his grades dropping, please just pick any other UC or CSU.

I toured UC Merced this year but I did not really get a vibe for how the campus is in regards to culture and community events.

I have a 3.6 unweighted GPA, 4.2 weighted GPA, and a 3.93 UC capped GPA.

I am interested in UC Merced because, from what I’ve heard, it has great research opportunities and great professors. UC Merced has the highest amount of undergrads involved in research within the UC system. Also, I believe the smaller class sizes compared to larger UCs also allow for a better learning environment because of easier access to professors.

After college, I want to pursue a PHD in some field of Physics. I think UC Merced is a great choice for me to apply to because of its smaller learning environment, easier access to professors, and opportunities to do research, which are heavily important for pursuing a PHD.

Are my assumptions correct? Is there any advice you can offer? How is the Physics Department at UC Merced? How easy is it really to get involved in research? At what year do students usually get access to research opportunities? Are there any other opportunities Physics majors have access to at UC Merced other than faculty-guided research?

Also, if we name it The Joy Luck Club (after the amy tan book) it gives us a reason to make food during meetings. (like we could do communal dumpling wrapping or sticky rice wrapping). The obvious problem with that is food safety but I am a clean freak and I can potentially get a food handlers certificate if we really need it. Honestly, this is kind of two club ideas in one but I think the mix of food and mahjong would be amazing. (I know there already is a Chinese culture club, but i want a club thats mahjong focused)

And there have been some backlash that were mentioned by my friends, which I would like to address about this professor:

* ~~One of his former students raged so hard to SteamPlug being so buggy, and soon Professor Angelo got very mad that (I forgot the rest..)~~ SteamPLUG is still in the beta stages, which unexpectedly could present bugs, however these bugs have remained minor.
* Someone claimed that his class was too easy so starting this year including this semester (Fall 2025), he made the classes a bit more harder
   * He started mentioning to me and  the whole ITP class that he wants us to start doing stuff on our own
      * Actually yeah, we haven't been receiving homework, which to be fair, we were to experiment the code on our own anyways. Not bad.
   * He also began hiring some tutors (not sure who) starting this week bc the quiz scores from the past were becoming poor
      * His tutors are meant to help students who receive bad scores on their quizzes and improve their grade



* SteamPlug is owned by him

Edit 21/10/25: Some of these rumors are true, but he's not a bad professor in person after weeks of having him. Trust me. See my long comment for the explanation. I've also denied the false promises of these rumors after several experiences.

UC Merced for Premed and College Life?,"Hi. I am a high school senior who will be graduating in May 2026.

I am from Sacramento, and I do not have a good opinion of the general Merced area, as it is relatively lacking development and has a higher crime rate, although I know anywhere can be dangerous if you aren’t practicing basic safety precautions.

I have a 3.6 unweighted GPA and a 4.2 weighted gpa. I am in the top 12% of my class (not 10% sadly, as I heard that makes admissions in some way easier). I am currently in the process of filling out my UC PIQs, and I want to know more about UC Merced.

If I were to be accepted, I would hopefully be majoring in the Neuroscience, B.S. Pre-Medical Emphasis program for premed. After graduation and the MCAT, I would want to attend medical school.

Although I am aware that I haven’t  even applied or been accepted to any schools yet, I am considering UC Merced over other UCs because of its smaller student body and perceived abundance of opportunities. I am aware that UC Merced does not have as high of a premed/medical reputation as schools like UC Davis, but I feel like UC Merced’s smaller class sizes would fit me better and give me more of a community experience.

I will get quicker to the point with a list of questions:

- UC Merced has the greatest amount of undergrads in research within the UC system due to its smaller student body. Are there also good research opportunities for premed?

- Is admission into UC Merced reasonable with my stats? 3.6 unweighted GPA and 4.2 weighted GPA. Top 12%. I believe my UC GPA is 3.87.

- Are there good extracurricular opportunities for premed, such as shadowing and volunteering at a local hospital or practice? In particular, I am interested in Family Medicine.  I am not familiar with the Merced area.

- How is UC Merced as an Asian? I am concerned about how I would fit in, as there is a significant difference in Asian presence in Merced compared to Sacramento.

- How is the campus and school environment? Is it a good learning environment? How much pressure and competition is present? How beautiful is the campus?

- How is the town of Merced now? What kind of experience does it offer? I need hotpot to survive. Is the crime as bad as some people say?

- Is UCM a commuter campus? I’d preferably want a larger on-campus experience and have more social exposure. Of course, I would proactively engage with others and join clubs too.",ucmerced,-0.23,Academics

UC Merced - A Story of Mismanagement,"Hi all,

So I just wanted to quickly rant about how fucking awful this campus has been run since the day I got here 6 years ago. Seems like it’s topical given the recent parking problems, and since this has been bouncing around in my mind for a while I wanted to get it off my chest. Before I really get into it I wanted to be very clear and say that I actually love UCM. I did my undergrad here, I continued to grad school here, and this city and campus have become a part of my life. My main gripe is with campus administration, and I think you’ll agree after reading this that they are the main obstacle to having a university we can be truly proud of. 

Let’s start with housing. When I first came here in 2019, there was a of directly associated off-campus housing with contractual obligations to the UC. Additionally there were the existing dormitories that are on campus today, some of which were under construction at the time. The dorms on academic walk were famously constructed by contractors who had rub shoulders and I must assume greased the wheels of campus admin, rather than winning their supposedly “competitive bid” honestly. It’s these same contractors that chalk up the lack of drop ceiling and exposed utilities to post-modern design and “ease of maintenance.” This decision is what allowed a student in the very first year of Glacier Point’s opening to hang from a water pipe on the 6th floor, causing to to break and rupture, thereby flooding the entire building. Say what you want about the kid, what kind of idiotic design doesn’t account for the fact that college students do stupid shit and maybe utilities shouldn’t be exposed???? The kind of design that doesn’t require any thinking and has the soul goal to extract as much money out of public funds as possible.

Second, let’s address food. Some of you may know about the absolute debacle that was the pavilion dining center immediately after COVID. For those of you who don’t, it was truly a horrific sight to see. Some famous highlights: bugs in the vegetables, Chernobyl burger patties, undercooked chicken, and skyrocketing cases of food-borne illness. I won’t spend too long on this because it’s been covered extensively, but there were two central issues with how the pavilion was operating. One, some of the absolute cheapest possible ingredients were being sourced from Sysco, resulting in really low quality to start with, and student workers at the pav were zoinked out of their minds. Literally hearing directly from employees that students would clock into their shift high, drunk, and even crossed, resulting in frequent mistakes in food preparation. Now you might ask, why? Ok sure, we all hate our jobs, but why are people making these decisions, coming into work so blasted that they can pretend it’s not their reality? Because the working conditions at the time were fucking awful, because they were criminally understaffed and underpaid, and because the pav admin didn’t care. See, something you need to understand to make sense of all these decisions is: the dining centers are not actually owned and operated by the university. Or rather, they are, but these entities exist as “private companies” within the UC system as a whole. These companies are in a funny situation. You see, they are expected to make a profit, but their income is mostly fixed. Given that most people who eat at the pavilion are on campus residents who pre-purchased a meal plan, the pav as a company doesn’t actually have to try to compete for your money. Given that the two DCs are the only fixed dining options on campus, and on campus residents have to pay extra to eat from the fairly inconsistent food trucks, they don’t even really HAVE any competition. Consider that on weekends, students literally only can eat at the DCs or pick up microwavable food from the student store, and I think you’ll understand my point. The DCs aren’t beholden to anyone, especially not their customers or employees. Students are forced to eat subpar food (which I will admit has gotten a little better over the years but is NOTHING compared to the food at other UCs) and workers are forced to work with scolding water without protection, their hours are not respected for class times, and they are underpaid leading to understaffing and overworking. This is remarkably different from how they operate UCLA’s dining hall, widely regarded as the best public university dining hall in the country. Now, why would a campus necessity, something that other campuses have proven can be better operated as part of their Housing, be operated as a private entity? Well that simple. To “save money”, UCM’s Project 2020 (which constructed the pav and all the dorms on academic walk) was operated as a public-private partnership. Using public funds to get private companies to build projects for the UC with a catch: the pavilion is, to this day, paying off its construction as well as accruing contractually mandated profits for Plenary Properties Merced, a shell of Plenary, a company the specializes in the business of public private partnership. Meaning they have no attachment to this campus, no obligation to run a real business, no interest in reinvesting all the money they have extracted out of this community back into it. 

Finally, TAPS. Ooohhhhh TAPS, I don’t think I’ve ever hated an entity as much as you. TAPS is actually the first element of campus administration to ever have been privatized, with its inception back in 2005 along with the beginnings of campus. Turns out, TAPS actually owns all the parking lots as their “own land” and to build the current work on housing and the potential future work on the student union, the university will have to “buy back” the land from ITSELF. Now that’s not really the most egregious thing. If anything, that’s just a matter of paperwork and shuffling money around. No, TAPS, although owned indirectly by the UC, is separately operated on a contractual basis by Laz parking. ",ucmerced,-0.83,Politics

Hello everyone! I've commented on this situation before on other posts but this is my first time doing my own post. As we know it the Bellevue lot is a hellish nightmare almost all hours of the day. I had class at 10:30am and got to the lot at 9:30am. The lot was FULL to the brim with cars already circling around trying to find a space. I had to park all the way in the back but by the green pathway and my class is in COB1. I come back after the long day to this ticket. Where I stand now is that I am REFUSING to pay and appealing. I encourage any commuters who get tickets to APPEAL APPEAL APPEAL! The campus does not deserve any more cash, it is an unjust bill for us. The permit is already full price and expensive for the amount of parking they are providing. 

Before the semester started I emailed TAPS about my worries with this construction at Bellevue and was ghosted, but now they want to present me a bill??? DRINK DOGWATER!",ucmerced,-0.73,Finance

PSA: Start planning things ahead of time. Do not wait till the last minute!!,"As someone who recently graduated in high school, trust me, school workload will not get easier as the school year progresses. I used to do things and plan them on my mind, but I easily get too caught up with unexpected events that interrupt my daily routine. Shortly realizing that Canvas puts in assignments as modules, I see that modules are divided into sections with each having an assignment due at a specific date &amp; time and maybe a pop quiz or two. Unlike high school, everything is laid out for you, no need to wait until the professor assigns the work.



To start planning the assignments, divide them into portions for each of the day you will do before the deadline. I recommend using a calendar system that can automatically schedule things that can adapt to your routine. I personally use [Reclaim.ai](http://Reclaim.ai) for this, but you can use whatever you like free or paid. I think for Ios users, [FlowSavy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowsavvy-ai-schedule-planner/id1620112581) is one of the popular options.

In your opinion (For current UCM students out there) what could you do to CatTracks to make it better?

Because in my experience every route they serve seems to overlap with each other, and also most lines (especially in the G St/Bellevue/Lake/Yosemite Ave. area) might benefit with a line removal to provide more increased frequencies. Plus not to mention, I would like a total re-doing of the entire bus network for better connectivity, (Airport connection will be so gas), plus it might help new students on which bus line to take.",ucmerced,-0.2,Academics

Merced Station: A Review - Callous Scam or Overhated Luxury?,"DISCLAIMER: No, I am not a shill or an employee working there. I am a first gen second year student that currently lives there and I didn't come from the richest background, so bear with me. I know I've only lived here for a week now but I felt the urge getting this out.

I've noticed around here that Merced Station (MS for convenience) hasn't had the most positive reception in this subreddit, mainly due to its over pricing. Yet, despite your guys' warnings, I decided to live there because I figured it would be more cheaper than living in the dorms again, not to mention my experience with the dorms on campus wasn't the greatest.

At first I was very skeptical for how high the rent rates were, especially for singles, so I opted to live in a 6 person shared unit, sharing a room with another person. But over my time living there, I noticed that there were many things that have come out of this place. I'll sum MS's pros and cons.

The Good: 
- MC's bus transportation is actually pretty good if you do not have a car to go to campus. They operate from 8-4:30 from Monday to Friday. On weekends, I recommend getting a decent bike to travel to campus.
-You can control your AC at MS to any temperate you want. 
-There's a good amount of places to hang out at MS. The pool, the gym, your own room, BBQ pits, the clubhouse, entertainment center and even an indoor movie theater.
-For bike owners, there is a bike rack in which you can store your bike. Not at lot of people in my building own a bike, so there's plenty of space.
-Since many people are busy doing something else, places like the gym and the pool are not overpopulated.
- The units themselves aren't bad. They have a kitchen, a living room and a washing machine and dryer near your room. The room itself are also bigger than the dorms. 

The Bad: 
- The rent here... yeah I can understand why people are critical about MS. For a unit with only two people living in it with separate rooms, the rent is like $1300. Absolutely insanity. You also have to pay for the move in fee which can cost over $1000.
- Hidden costs actually persist. For example you also have to keep in mind that you have to pay for utilities and an optional service that reports your payment history to credit bureaus. Fees and fees just hand up to themselves. 
- Service can be very unhelpful, especially online, though that's very typical for places like this.
- You cannot request to move into a new unit if you get chanced with a bad roommate (to my knowledge, someone fact check me on this).
- Biking to campus during the afternoon can be hellish. Like, man it's only for 15 minutes but Merced isn't the most car friendly town. At least the distance from MS to the UC isn't too far.
- If you're living with 6 other people like me, and your arrived last, you're gonna have trouble finding space for your dining plates and food, unless you're willing to commute eat on campus.

The Ugly: 
- It can get a bit boring at times. If you're wanting to make new friends here, it will be a bit difficult as everyone is busy with their own lives. 
- The parking here is mid because it's usually limited to residents and is compact. But at least it's better than leaving your cars out in the hot sun with no shade at all!
- Some gated doors are broken. Idk if this is a good thing or a bad thing as a robber may get inside, but at least you don't have to use your keys.
- You must inspect your room and kitchen and living room and bathroom for any damages within 72 hours of moving in or else they won't fix it unless you pay them really high. Luckily, this did not happen to me [yet].

My experience so far: Unlike what most people are thinking, I actually think it's not that bad? Lemme explain myself first before your raise your pitchforks and torches. Like yeah, there's some practices that MS that may warrant some hate from people, but I'd say that if you're looking for a better life out from the dorms and some actual things to do (ignoring rent), then maybe MS is the place for you! To me so far, nothing has really broken down and there's plenty of amenities to do. The issue is that I wish MS was a bit more lively at times just for the vibe itself. 

Final verdict: If do not have the money, then yeah I recommend avoiding this place. Otherwise, MS is what you make out of it. It offers a lot of things for you, and it is your choice to use them as you wish and see if your money is actually worth to stay here. It could be the next step into living on your own from what I theorize. I'll let your responses be the judge. Good night, Merced! ",ucmerced,-0.23,Finance

HOW TO TAKE THE BUS,"I'm writing this because I literally wasted an hour+ of my life trying to figure out how buses work and want to pass on my knowledge. Some of this might be completely as wrong Ive literally only been in Merced for 2 days, but it's better than Google that's for sure.

By the way, as far as I understand all busses are free as long as you have your cat card. 

First up: Literally everything on Google maps is wrong(as of August 22nd, 2025). If you look up ""bus stop"" it gives you 3 bus stops on campus, literally none of these are still in service lmao. The actual stop doesn't show up.

The stop you're looking for is ""UTC"". It's next to the southern parking lot. It's technically 2 stops right next to each other, UTC south and UTC north. This is where you'll usually get on.

Lines: https://taps.ucmerced.edu/transportation  this site has all the lines(alternatively look up cat track), on weekends only lines E and D are running. It's really dumb since all it gives you is a list of locations and not an actual map of where they are, so you just gotta figure it out(or ask a bus driver like I did) I can tell you that the G line takes you straight to the city center though.

When getting on, scan your id near the entrance and you're good.

I also intend to make this a registered organization, so that students across UC Merced striving for a competitive gaming experience in these games have a place to thrive. Currently, there is no active registered organization for any of these games.

Currently, I am doing outreach to look for a UC Merced staff member or graduate student willing to be an advisor for our club. If you are interested in being one or have an idea of someone who may be interested, please let me know.

I encourage all incoming students who are interested in joining to join our Discord, and any interest in being a staff member or assistance with helping me set this up will be greatly appreciated.

Just took my kid to orientation and am freaking out about the city and UCM,"Let me give some quick background. My kid didn’t choose UCM. They ranked top 9% in their HS class and was placed in the ELC program for students. That means if they were waitlisted at any UC applied to, they’d be placed at UCM for a guaranteed UC campus spot. In other words we felt we were playing with house money. Also note that they will be 3rd generation college student, so they aren’t new to being around higher educated individuals. My spouse is also a full professor at another university.

However, after our visit this week, it’s not the slam dunk that we thought and we have concerns.

1. The town of Merced leaves much to be desired. While my wife and kid were at orientation, my goal was to check out the town. Not very vibrant. I can see the potential, but what’s holding it back? Being from the Midwest, it felt like a larger country town.

2. During the intro calls, they indicated there was a regional airport available to get back to Southern California. Turns out that only sits 6-8 and tickets need to be purchased at least 4 months in advance.

3. They also mentioned they can bring car. Turns out that needs a special exemption. That would leave my kid in the middle of nowhere with not great transport options.

4. There’s a high first gen attendance rate. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but my kid was looking forward to finding more of an academic tribe. Not saying that’s not still possible, but seems like it will take a lot of legwork on their part.

5. Some of the students my wife spoke with, alluded to terrible academic counseling and to expect a 4.5 year experience vs completion in 4 years.

The pros that I saw.

1. The campus is beautiful and seems like it will cultivate learning and on campus social life.

2. The new construction shows the investment taking place on campus.

3. The move of sports from NAIA to Division 2 athletics is a good indicator of progress in my mind.

4. It appears there will be plenty of research opportunities for them, but are staff capable of providing effective guidance.

With their AP and dual enrollment credits, my kid will be going in as a 2nd year, which is great. 

As a parent, I just want them to be in the best spot for their success. I don’t want them to settle, especially since they didn’t apply, they were placed.

Any help to alleviate our concerns? Thanks

Is dropping one of my classes to get more involved a bad idea?,"Hey people!! I’m going into my third year of uni (civil engineering major) and am currently registered for 4 classes (MATH024, PHYS009, ENGR057, ENGR045). I have been wanting to get more involved in school but have always placed more priority in getting good grades (3.86 GPA). Whenever I try joining clubs or applying for jobs, I find myself bailing out when class material gets rough. Would it be a bad idea to drop one of my classes and put more time into working and joining clubs? My biggest fear is that I graduate soon but have no experience or involvement in anything. I don’t mind taking longer to graduate because my school is almost fully paid for by FAFSA and other aid, but I’m not sure if there’s something I may be missing. Any advice?

Fall 25 Class Registration,"Hi everyone! 

When would I apply for my classes as a junior level transfer student? I talked with someone and they told me an advisor for my major would email me and let me know later in the summer (?) but I just wanted to get clarification from any previous transfer students.

Registration question from an incoming transfer student,"Hi all! I’m an incoming community college transfer student and I had a couple questions about registration. I’m obviously used to how it works at my previous college, but the UCM one is MUCH different than what i’m used to. 
1) What are linked classes? Does that mean I need to enroll in the class that the one i’m intending to register is linked to? 
2) How quickly do waitlists move? I’m used to them moving very quickly especially the last year because of the uptick in cc financial aid fraud/ghost students, but I can’t imagine that’s as big of an issue at UCM. My registration date isn’t til the end of June and most of the classes I want to register for are already full (with open waitlists though) 
Thanks so much if you can answer either of these:) ",ucmerced,0.73,Academics

D in First Semester Senior year,"Hi guys! I need some help. How likely is my offer to get rescinded?

I took AP Calc AB and one semester of AP Calc BC, fall semester. My school operates on a quarter system, but the school's counselors told us to enter our classes as semesters. Anyway, I ended up taking three quarters of Calc instead of two (one semester) because the AB units were not covered by then. I got a C in the first quarter, a D in the second, then a C in the third (Calc BC). These are the lowest grades I've ever had; the rest of my grades are mostly As and occasional B's. 

Apart from that, I've taken courses at my community college throughout high school (12 classes), same thing, As and Bs until Fall 2024. I got greedy, apart from AP Calc, I took AP Gov, Econ, and lit, and 3 college classes, theater, piano, and drawing 1. I got a D in drawing one (not the quality of work I submitted, but the quantity), but I plan to retake it this summer of 25. I submitted a course update to the school. Is there anything else I can do?

Will I have to take courses that don't apply?,"Hi everyone,

Transfer student here and i'm planning/looking at which courses I need to take and which are available. I'm an applied math major and I've noticed that there are a lot of prerequisite courses that do not fulfill required course requirements. An example is like CSE 31 having CSE 30 as a prerequisite but CSE 30 doesn't apply to any requirements I need so I'll just be taking it solely for the purpose of taking CSE 31. In total I have around 23 courses to take over 4 semesters (with maybe 1-3 classes overlapping some sections) so probably around 21. This is still a minimum of 5 classes a semester PLUS any course that doesn't even apply that I have to take as a prerequisite like I mentioned.

This just seems like a lot and for satisfying the Writing in the Discipline GE I have no idea how I'll take any of the courses without first taking 1 or 2 prerequisite courses.

EDIT: I've realized that 2 upper div math courses satisfy 2 GE requirements as well + didn't realize 1 class was listed as 2 due to a lab. Total classes i'm looking at is 18 + 2-3 at minimum over 4 semesters. I think if I take 2 classes during the summer sessions that I'll be able to knock down the number I courses I need to take per semester to around 4 at the lowest.",ucmerced,-0.33,Academics

Academically dismissed.,"So I have been officially academically dismissed. Please read all of this, as I truly need help if this is worth appealing at this point. 

So I transferred from a CC to UCM in 2023. I went through a lot in fall - spring of 2023-2024 and I did a educational leave which got approved for. Fall of 2024 comes and I got diagnosed with early cervical cancer. I did another educational leave which got approved again so I technically started over for the spring 2025 semester. I passed 3/4 classes but the one class I didn’t pass, I communicated for a whole month explaining my situation and how I needed one exam that I missed (which is worth all of my grade btw), and that if I could please make it up. Knowing that I obviously have help from my amazing counselor (Linda Safer), I did a meeting with her and explained that I couldn’t do in person classes and all my professors were okay with it and worked with me except this one professor. She said she would talk to him but he persisted with the “no makeup exams”. Which I get, but that was the only class I needed to pass all of my classes. Which led me to be academically dismissed. 

I went though a lot this semester as well: 
 - mental health
- physical health 
- being a single mother 
- being evicted and having to move 2 hours away from UCM 
- my son getting a UTI from a dishonest and ignorant daycare teacher
- getting my phone stolen in mexico

Due to that they've unfortunately decided to most likely not apply to UCM because they think they'll have no chance getting in. We understand the mission to serve underserved areas, but I was wondering why not open it up more broadly? Wouldn’t expanding access increase the program’s visibility, attract more applicants, and help boost UC Merced’s reputation overall? Has anyone outside the region ever gotten in?

Going to UC Riverside or UC Merced doesn’t make your stupid. I’m a PhD student at UCLA and understand the process of admission.,"First, I want to share a bit about my background: I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Riverside and am currently a PhD student at UCLA. I was actually admitted to UCLA for undergrad as well, but I chose UC Riverside due to the cost of living. Although my tuition was covered—since I was raised in a low-income, single-parent household—living expenses in Los Angeles were significantly higher than in Riverside, and that played a major role in my decision.

Now, as a PhD student at UCLA and a teaching assistant, I’ve had the chance to work closely with students. One thing I’ve observed is that, just like at UC Riverside, there are students here who are unmotivated or not particularly engaged. Of course, there are many incredibly bright and driven students at UCLA, but the idea that every student here is exceptional simply isn’t true. On average, I would say that students at UCLA tend to be more ambitious, but that doesn’t mean students at UC Riverside lack drive—it’s just a different overall environment.

I’ve also served on admissions committees, where applications are typically reviewed by a mix of graduate students, retired counselors, and administrative staff—many of whom hold bachelor’s or master’s degrees from lesser-known institutions. Surprisingly, professors are rarely involved in the initial review process, as they are often focused on research. When faculty are involved, it’s usually lecturers or adjuncts—positions that unfortunately don’t carry the same weight or prestige as tenured roles. At times, I’ve questioned whether some admissions decisions truly reflect a deep understanding of a student’s potential.

What I want to say is this: don’t be discouraged. Keep working hard. If you maintain strong grades and seek meaningful experiences, you’ll find success—regardless of which UC campus you attend.

UCM vs CPP CS,"Hey all, I'm a 24 y/o CS major who was initially set to transfer to Cal Poly Pomona since I got rejected or waitlisted from all the UCs I applied for. However, UC Merced allowed me to apply through their Count Me In program.
I know CPP is supposed to offer a more ""hands-on"" approach while UCs provide more theoretical foundations for research, but I feel I wouldn't mind either. 
 
In the case I'm accepted into UCM, I'd like to ask for any insight and things to consider in deciding between the two. 
 
I'm already in CPP's MEP program and applied for their Honors College after being invited to do so. Unsure if I'd get housing. I should get priority registration through accessibility services. Their financial aid estimates $14k a year in total expenses. 
 
If UCM ends up offering more FA, I wonder if it'd end up being the better choice... but I hear a lot about the boredom people experience there. I'm no party person, but I still wonder how the quality of life would be like through an academic year. That said, I can also see the benefits of having UC resources and a relatively new campus without the similar competition and class sizes as one would typically expect. More of my credits might transfer towards my major, too, since I took Calc III + Linear Algebra &amp; Diff. EQs this Spring, and those classes either aren't required or don't fulfill a lower div for CS at CPP while they do at UCM. I also ideally wouldn't be staying at UCM for my entire undergrad since I've always wanted to study abroad for a year at some point.

I know that people on this sub would probably be more biased towards UCM, but any thoughts would be appreciated!

"E-scooter stolen from the scooter parking by Lot 15, Pentland Hills",I blame myself because I should’ve thought about it. There’s one camera facing toward the corner and I doubt it even works. The parking is feet away &amp; would make for a very easy escape. Lock got sawn through so I’m guessing they scout out the area &amp; look for higher value scooters. Mine was decently expensive &amp; I guess they knew that &amp; went on a day at a time when they figured I wouldn’t be there. I’d appreciate it if you guys could report this to the campus but I suspect they already know about it. Some people walking by just told me “it’s a recurring thing” very casually so I really doubt UC cares about it at all. ,ucr,-0.73,Housing

Pretty regularly, a girl will compliment my style or say I'm pretty and I just have the urge to ask them if they wanna be friends but my mind goes blank because im so bad at talking to people so i just say thank you and walk away. Other times I'll admire a girl in the gym and i want to go up to her and make friendly conversation but when I smile at them, they won't even smile back. And in class or in clubs, everyone already had designated friends and aren't looking to talk to anyone except for the people they already know or they just kind of hold a surface level conversation with you and you never talk to them again.

Having platonic guy or girl friends while in a relationship?,"I wanna keep this post as neutral as i can, but what r your guys opinions about having guy and girl friends while dating someone? 

Reason i ask is cuz recently, a friend of mine got like cheated on by his girl (now ex gf obviosuly) with a guy friend she had been meeting too. I dont know the complete details but i just know that the ex gf and the dude bestie were very close and hung out one on one like a lot and eventually they hooked up. Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol. 

But ya, i mean i would love to hear your guys thoughts cuz i def think a lot of ppl here and in general are completely fine with platonic friends which i agree, but like when youre dating, i personally would start to hope she would spend more time with me than them cuz well im her bf right?

Free Registration Help for all Undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students!,"Hiii! Feeling lost with which classes to register for? Frustrated with the advisors?! Looking for some advice on what classes to take and which professors to look out for? I remember when I was stressing myself out freshman/sophomore year trying to make sure I get all the classes I need to graduate but had no one older than me to ask for advice and help.  And the academic advisors are not the best nor most helping. That being said there are some things that only an academic advisor can help you with (holds, academic probation etc etc.) but when it comes to registering for classes they are not the most knowledgeable!

what is going on ( transfer student eddition),"Hey everyone, I hope you take a moment to read this and maybe share some encouragement or advice. I just transferred to UCR from the Bay as a 3rd-year, and I was *so* excited to get started — but honestly, it’s been tough facing what feels like transfer judgment.

I’m a really outgoing person, and I’ve been putting myself out there these past few weeks, going to a lot of recruitment events for both professional frats and clubs. But it’s been discouraging getting dropped just because I’m a 3rd-year transfer — like, that’s not something I can control. It sucks feeling like I’m being judged for my year instead of what I can actually bring to the table.

I know I only have two years here, so I’ve been trying to make the most of it, but it’s hard when it feels like people overlook you for freshmen who have “more time.” Honestly, my community college felt more welcoming than this — it’s been a real culture shock.

At this point, I’m still going to keep putting myself out there because I don’t want to give up, but I can’t help feeling a little discouraged. Has anyone else gone through this? I swear I’m friendly and really don’t like just staying in bed doing nothing — I just want to find my people here.

I’ve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I’d post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! 

Here’s a little about me! 

I (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don’t get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it’s one of my favorite past times. I’m also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I’m specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven’t played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I’m starting to watch more horror movies, so I’ll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I’m just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out!

At Risk Animal Discord,"Hi everyone!

Not sure if this is allowed but I recently developed a system where it would periodically scan animal shelter websites for at risk animals in danger of being put down and automatically posting them on the following discord server:

https://discord.gg/usmQtjrVv

The plan at the moment is to have it scheduled to scan the sites weekly every Sunday and post the at risk animals on the discord. But I’m awaiting my next paycheck so that I can buy some setup for a server to host this.

Because I’m a broke individual and I’m essentially using entirely free services, I’m just having this system scan primarily the Riverside shelters (Coachella Valley Animal Campus, Riverside County West Animal Shelter, and the San Jacinto Shelter)

But if anyone’s interested in helping these animals find a home. Feel free to check it out.",ucr,-0.2,Other

What Would It Take to Bring “The Barn” at UCR Back to Its Glory Days?,"I’m a local who’s been curious about The Barn over at UCR. I remember when it had that laid-back, college-town vibe — good food, local music, and a real sense of community. Past years though, it feels like that energy’s kind of faded, and I’m wondering what it would take to bring it back to life.

For those who used to hang there (or still do):
- What made The Barn special to you back in the day?
- What would actually get you to go again if they tried to revive it?

Would things like these help?
	•Live music or open-mic nights
	•Affordable eats and drinks that don’t feel too “campus exclusive”
	•Local breweries or food pop-ups
	•Community events that blend students and locals
	•Or just a more relaxed, authentic vibe like it used to have

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts — especially from current students, alumni, longtime Riverside residents, or anyone who remembers what made The Barn the hangout spot. What would you love to see happen there again?

The goal of this project is to advocate for best practices by looking at both the undergraduate student and Teaching Assistant (TA) perspectives. Participation in the survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete if all questions are answered, but you can skip questions or select ""prefer not to answer"" if you don't want to provide certain pieces of information. Participants must be 18 years or older to complete the survey.

Just had to say: Went in the server asking for help and ended up getting kicking out, so I went in again. Then I realized it was for SI leaders only before getting kicked out AGAIN. I then decided to go back in one last time so I could get referred to the right place. The dude told me to go to an SI session to find out then proceeded to kick me and ban me. Like I understand you wanna have a little private chat for SI leaders only, but I thought the purpose of SI leaders were to answer questions for those who have them? I got my chemistry questions ready and my test coming soon but I can't get a single ounce of help from the 20 SI leaders available in that group chat?

socially frustrated as a transfer commuter,"hello, just venting
I'm a transfer student, first week here. I also commute (not a long distance at all, but I take the bus with no car). I don't know how to make friends. I was homeschooled (non-religious purposes) and then did only school for high school. I did one year of community college in which time I had two in person classes. I would consider myself well adapted and not a weird person at all (exclusively due to having online friends). I'm very academically driven and a thoughtful person. but honestly it feels like that latter bit is to a fault. I feel like I overthink EVERYTHING. I can't do small talk. the only thing I talk to anybody about is name, major, and school related things. I'm also an introverted person, not to an extreme extent but I don't overshare and I find it hard to express myself very hard. it also doesn't help that I'm 18 and in my third year, although I know this isn't really a huge factor.
It feels like every ""normal"" person in this school already has a group of friends to talk to. I feel such a barrier to trying to talk to these people even though they're the people I'd actually want to talk to. there's this dude who was at my transfer orienation and is now in 2 of my classes, so I'm like ""I should probably talk to this guy"" but he already has his group of friends and I just don't know how to do it. I'm NOT really an awkward person, I just have walls up it feels like and it's so frustrating.
the only people I can easily chat up are people in my classes who are not very social. and no offense, but most of them are just kind of weird. I started off sitting at the front of classes because I wanted to succeed and connect with professors, and I'm now finding myself a couple rows back because I just feel like I can't connect with the people in the front for the most part. and then I can't connect with the people further back either who are actually sociable so I don't know what to do.
I also joined a club (ACM) but (also no offense) it's the same archetype of people I don't really care to socialize with. I'm in one of the projects so hopefully there are cool people in that when it starts but I just don't know.
everyone feels so connected already, or not connected at all. I want to be the former but I'm drifting towards the latter and I hate it.
honestly all my self confidence is shot right now. I don't know. hopefully this changes soon but it's just so hard to make friends here for me.",ucr,-0.43,Mental Health

Biopsych/ Pre-dental,"Hi everyone! For context I am a second year PBS major (on paper) but I have been doing biology coursework for the past year in hopes of switching into the major. However, the first year for both PBS and Bio are effectively the same in coursework so this fall has been my first real year doing biology coursework. 
In short, I am taking MCDB1A, CHEM 109A, PHYS 6A+6AL, and CHEM2BL. I have already failed the first physics midterm and will likely be retroactively withdrawing the class and I didn’t do particularly well on my other exams.
This has led me towards wanting to save physics for next year and fill my schedule w PSYCH 10A/B for the winter and spring and declare biopsych+ pre-health so I wouldn’t have to fully switch departments, and the upper division courses seem more interesting as well. 

I’m torn about this decision though because I really want to go into healthcare, primarily dental, but I feel like my academics aren’t very strong, and I don’t even have a job or many clubs taking away from my study time. 

Basically I’m asking this:
- Is pre-med/dental worth pursuing if i’m struggling as much as I am now in lower division courses?
- Should I cut my losses and stick with my on paper PBS major?

I also have a 3.5 overall GPA with a 3.2 in major courses (gen chem didn’t go very well).

1989's passing of our Mathematics Prof and Japanese Lecturer,"I'm an alum from '85 to '89. Still sometimes haunted by the passing of my favorite teacher, Keiko Mochizuki. She taught Japanese, and in '89 students held a vigil in support of her and her ailing husband Horace Mochizuki, our Mathematics Professor. And then he passed, and then shortly after, she passed. They left behind two daughters. It felt like that tragedy and grief came out of left field. We were stunned. I don't know what we could have done.

I graduated that year and moved away. Maybe I'd have gotten better closure if I'd stayed and processed with others. There are memorial awards now, and that's a good thing.",UCSantaBarbara,-0.33,Academics

Advice from UCSB faculty for students registering for Winter Quarter: Check with your advisor!,"UCSB faculty here with some recommendations to make your Gaucho experience less stressful and more productive.

**Before signing up for Winter Quarter classes, check with an academic advisor.**

The schedule of classes and your registration pass times are now available on GOLD. You probably have a good idea of what courses to enroll in for Winter Quarter. But remember that every major at UCSB involves a complicated web of courses, some required and some optional, and even the best-prepared student can sometimes get tangled up in that web. 

The best way to avoid errors and ensure that you're taking the correct classes to progress toward your degree is to **meet with an academic advisor before your pass time.** If you're already in a major, that'll be an advisor in your major department; if you're undeclared, that will be one of the advisors in the College of Letters and Science (https://www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising).

Sad to say, I've seen too many students who did not take this advice — and who suffered unpleasant consequences as a result. A recent unhappy example was a student who needed to take a sequence of required courses for their major. Most students in that major start this sequence in Winter Quarter of their first year, but this student decided on their own — and without consulting with an academic advisor — that they would wait until Fall Quarter of their second year to start. Imagine their reaction when it came time to register for Fall Quarter classes, and they discovered that the first course in this required sequence is only offered in Winter or Spring! This student is now going to either (a) be a year behind or (b) have to take these courses at a community college. Either one of these options means extra time and extra expense for this student to graduate. **Don't let this happen to you!**

So please make a point of meeting with an academic advisor before your first pass time. It will just take a few minutes for them to confirm that your proposed list of Winter Quarter courses is correct — or to suggest changes in that list to help ensure that you're on the right academic track.

Winter '26 courses now viewable in GOLD,"It's that time, folks.

For frosh/transfers who've blocked out the nerve-wracking summer orientation session wherein you registered for fall classes, I've included a screenshot so you can find when your pass times are.

***NOW*** is the time to start putting courses in your registration cart. Set an alarm/Google reminder of when your 1st pass time starts. Don't say to yourself, ""Meh, I'll get on that the next morning..."" That's a recipe for frustration. Register for classes ***as soon as*** your pass time opens.

This may seem elementary to a lot of folks on this sub, but trust me: there are dozens of students every January/week 1 who are scrambling for classes bc they ""forgot about pass times."" Oof.

Also: If there's a winter class you'd anticipated taking that you don't see in ""Find Courses,"" I'd encourage you to contact your department advisors for additional information/clarification. E.g. a student just asked me about MCDB 110 not being available in winter quarter. I reached out to the department and learned, ""Though MCDB 110 Biochemistry won't be offered this coming W26, the plan is to instead offer one very large offering in S26, which will have the equal amount of the usual annual combined seating.  Our 25/26 offerings are listed on our website under [Proposed MCDB courses for 2025-2026](https://undergrad.biology.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025-2026%20Courses%208-28.pdf).""

ILP Bike Path Update,"Dear UCSB Community,

We are the A.S. Bike Committee, the student-led and funded committee that pays for the construction and maintenance of our campus bicycle infrastructure. We would like to provide an update on the progress of the planned ILP Bike Path, and clarify Bike Committee’s role in the new bicycle safety and enforcement program. 

Last spring, after several years of advocacy from the Bike Committee, campus administration conceptually approved a replacement bike path between the Library and ILP. The Bike Committee immediately initiated the planning and design process for a layout that includes both a new path and two roundabouts connecting it to the existing bike network. A preliminary sketch is below. We are now within weeks of receiving the finalized blueprints and cost estimate for the project. At that point, the last step before construction will be raising enough funds to complete construction. Although we anticipate funding to be a challenge, Bike Committee, A.S., and the Office of Budget and Planning will work together to make it happen as soon as possible. We are extremely confident that this bike path will be built. 

We also want to address the widespread concern regarding the ticketing of bikers on walkways as part of the school’s new “Bike Safety and Enforcement” program. We would like to emphasize that Bike Committee did not make the decision to begin police enforcement, and we recognize that increased police presence on campus is never an ideal solution. Our contribution to the program was to develop the educational module offered to cited bikers. Completing the module allows you to completely waive the $40 ticket fine. Bike Committee saw this as the best way to redirect the effort from enforcement to education.

Hopefully this information eases some of your concerns. We appreciate your patience as Bike Committee works towards a permanent solution that supports UCSB’s beloved bike culture.  

[Preliminary design plan by campus architect Ernest Knapp](https://preview.redd.it/xkdw7ffhhivf1.png?width=8550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1949e62e97425970b11012741cbd390cf9c1a2a0)

If you have any questions or input, please contact Bike Committee at [bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu](mailto:bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu)

For further context regarding the ILP Bike Path, see our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1i0wesd/ilp_bike_path_update_from_as_bike_committee/) from January.

Looking for people to build (cool cs project) with.,"Hi,

I’m a CS major looking to team up with others to build something meaningful. Back in high school, I created a ""prototype"" of this project. It was an adoption platform focused on connecting people with animals at risk of euthanasia. The problem was that everything became very messy and we (a friend and I) ended up abandoning the project. However, I think this project has a lot of potential and I would like to rebuilt it much better, and have it reach a lot a people.

Project: Petbound – an adoption website exclusively for animals at risk of euthanasia

Skills welcome:

\- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS, TypeScript, Next.js

\- Backend: SQL, Python, (still deciding which database)

\- Machine Learning: web scraping, collaborative filtering, reinforcement models for user preference learning

\- Marketing / Business: outreach strategy, user growth, exposure

\- SEO / Cybersecurity: any level of experience helps

I’ve got a structured roadmap ready since I’ve already built a working prototype before—just messy. What I really need now is just a some people who are really interested and want to build this with me.

If this sounds interesting, I’d love to talk and see if we can build something great together. You don’t need to be a CS major—just curious and motivated. And if you already have expertise, even better.

If your primary motivation is your resumé, then I'll add in the fact that I have a very solid plan to make this the largest website for animals at risk of euthanasia in the nation (given that I find enough people to build this), so it'll look great on your resume.

If enough people are interested, then I'll set up a place for all of us to meet &amp; explain my plan for the project in detail and what working on the project might look like.",UCSantaBarbara,-0.23,Academics

"Trying to Figure out my Career - Still only a Sophomore, but I wanna know what Direction I should take","Hi y'all, I'm a sophomore, trying to achieve my BS in Physics. I've always been drawn into physics by how fundamental it is to everything surrounding us; I think that I can be applied to almost every other science out there, which is why it is such an important foundation in our lives and society.

While I've always been drawn to it, I've never been confident in which specific direction of physics I want to pursue. By that, I mean that I'm unsure which area of physics I should moving into my masters' years (which I intend to do, but I'm also unsure how to navigate yet), as well as what career or job I should have in mind while I pursue my studies. I'll help y'all out a little bit regarding who I am and what I want in my career: I want a stable, well-paying job (obviously) that I am satisfied with and will complement the BS in physics that I plan to graduate with from college. One important thing that I think that I should mention is that I frankly really dislike working with and around other people, especially for long periods of time; I'm really sensitive to noise and it severely distracts me from focusing, I've never contributed much to groups because I suffer from social anxiety, and overall I suppose that I perform far better by myself academically. I also have poor muscle coordination and I don't really work well hands-on. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm kind of autistic (lol), but I really want to find a career to pursue where those characteristics don't mitigate whatever position or role which I will be in. Also, I know that it probably sounds extremely cliche and like a pipe dream, but I really want to just change the world somehow; just do something where I will be remembered and leave a legacy behind in my name. Again, I'm not sure how or what yet, but I know that's what I want. And that of course leads me to ask which field of physics I should pursue, the steps in order to attain certifiable experience in that field, and how it will complement whichever job might be best suited for me. The steps before entering the job market especially, I am honestly pretty unfamiliar with and don't really know how to use to propel myself towards my career. I commute an hour to my school, so college resources aren't as readily available as I hope they would be. If there's anything specific at UC Santa Barbara that I should look into, please let me know! And this doesn't even cover how and where I should receive my masters from, as well as how to network with people (which is a whole different issue for me).

Basically, I want to know which steps that I should take in pursuit of the career that I want, and even what career would fit me best based on my personality. I just kind of want a roadmap and goals that I can set for myself and follow. I know that there are so many possibilities for my career, especially only as an undergraduate college student, but I really want to have an idea of which direction I should take my future to.",UCSantaBarbara,-0.23,Academics

Lonely—but I hate alcohol I won’t befriend people who drink; it goes against my moral code,"Going to this school is so weird for me. On one hand, it’s one of the best public schools in the country for my major (physics), and the climate and opportunities for a physics career are excellent here. On the other hand, why the hell did I go to the #1 party school in the country when I’m literally the least party-going person on the planet? I hate alcohol so much it’s not even funny—it’s the reason why I can’t ever see my father again, and it’s the reason why I have such a tense relation with my mother. I can’t stand to be around inebriated people because they make so little sense to me, especially as somebody with Asperger’s and awful social skills, I feel gaslit and hurt and I hate it I hate it I hate it. I’ve been to a few parties also, i know no one’s forcing to me to go them (hence why I commute and don’t like in IV, thank god), but I feel like everybody here drinks and I hate it so much.

I’ve been getting into surfing recently (only been out like 5 times, so still very new), and I’d love to find people who’d be down to go out, whether it’s to play pickleball, hike, surf, walk, tan, play tennis, or just explore.

I’ve been trying to get involved (like auditioning for Untitled Dance and checking out clubs like Excursion Club), but it’s been pretty hard to actually join or go on trips since there’s so much competition. Also, it feels like there haven’t really been any transfer-specific mixers or events where you can actually meet people, which makes it even harder to connect.

Introducing RateMyGaucho - Professor Reviews Right in Your GOLD,"Hi y'all,

Winter 2026 registration is approaching. I built a Chrome extension called ""RateMyGaucho"" that brings professor reviews directly into GOLD while you're browsing classes, so you don't have to constantly switch tabs.

The extension is super lightweight and adds:

* UCSB Plat professor ratings displayed right under professor names in GOLD
* Hover tooltips showing overall rating, difficulty, would take again %, and number of reviews
* Direct links to full professor profiles if you want to read more
* Works seamlessly with GOLD's interface without any lag

(Also, RateMyGaucho is now featured on the UCSB Plat home page banner! 🎉)

Here are some screenshots:

**How to use:**

1. Download RateMyGaucho from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ratemygaucho/pgdlhncoocgekdmdiikdlgkndihcobhh?authuser=0&amp;hl=en)
2. Make sure the extension is active
3. Go to GOLD and browse classes like normal
4. You'll now see ratings under each professor's name automatically

I hope RateMyGaucho helps you make better decisions during registration and saves you time from tab switching. It's a new project, so there might be some bugs, and I'd appreciate any feedback you have.

If you're interested in contributing or have ideas for new features, the project is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsloganmann/RateMyGaucho).

what even is a “full time student” 😭,"ok so i’m a 3rd year at ucsb and i think i’m actually gonna drop one of my classes bc i just cannot deal with this section anymore. it’s way too much, the workload, the schedule, literally everything.

and ALSO this class’s section is WAY too early. like why do we do this. i wake up at 3pm!! leave me alone!! whoever decided sections should start at 8am should have to attend them themselves.

anyway, if i drop it, i’ll only have 8 units which apparently means i’m not a “full time student” anymore?? like what does that even mean 💀 i’m not an international student, i don’t live on campus, and i don’t get financial aid or scholarships. so does it even matter??

i would be down to find a replacement class, but it’s basically week 3 already?? like can i even add anything at this point?? from what i’ve seen, you need an add code from the professor after week 2, but that just feels awkward to ask for lol.

also… what do i even say to the professor i’m dropping from?? “hi i don’t wanna be in your class anymore it sucks”? 😭😭😭

and honestly i was even thinking about dropping the whole quarter, but of course they made that so difficult with like a million forms and petitions. so even though i want to, i’m not doing all that paperwork crap. these schools swear they care about students but they really don’t. and don’t even get me started on professors who are like “you’re allowed to miss two classes a quarter! 🥺” like GIRL i have a life leave me alone!!!

Switching to CS,"Hi, I'm a second year computer engineering major and looking to switch to CS. I'm primarily want to do this because I don't really have much of an interest in CE as I don't see myself working on chips and other hardware related stuff. This has been because my interests have changed towards working on medtech/biotech related work using CS/AI. Additionally, the flexibility CS has over CE is very important for me as I can invest my time into research, clubs, projects, etc. vs me doing work that I don't want to even do.

My problem is that I have a very low GPA due to a health condition I faced during mid winter quarter all the way until mid spring quarter (\~ 10 weeks) and unfortunately I wasn't compensated for my sickness in terms of exam deadlines (yes for homework here and there but didn't make too much of an impact). Due to my low GPA I don't meet one of the minimum requirements. I'm just in a dilemma right now as it feels like I'm paying money towards classes I don't even want to do that are major requirements while having the possibility of screwing up my GPA even more bcs these are some hard engineering classes.

Also, how does the process usually go?  
Would I be interviewed and be given example questions to test my knowledge? I guess the professor would definitely want to talk to me first before letting me join, but would it be more about what kind of person I am or how knowledgable I am? Although I have taken a lot of relevant courses, I'm honestly worried that I forgot a lot of the stuff that I've learned over the years. Then should I try to study all these again before I apply?  
I know these are honestly stupid questions but I'm so nervous because I've never even tried applying for researches/internships and I want to give this shot my best so any kind of advice would be appreciated.",UCSantaBarbara,-0.33,Academics

Starting SIGGRAPH@UCSB – Looking for computer graphics enthusiasts!,"Hey everyone,

We’re starting **SIGGRAPH@UCSB**, a new ACM SIGGRAPH student chapter on campus. Right now, it’s still in the formation stage, and we’re looking for people who are interested in **computer graphics** in any form.

If you’ve ever been curious about things like:

* How **Blender** (or other DCC tools) actually work under the hood
* How **ray tracing** and **path tracing** algorithms simulate light
* What’s really happening at the **GPU architecture** level when rendering
* How **physics engines** simulate motion, fluids, or collisions
* Or you just enjoy digging into the technical side of visual computing

…then you’d fit right in!

Our goals for the chapter:

* Build a student community around graphics at UCSB
* Run workshops &amp; discussions on rendering, simulation, and GPU programming
* Watch and break down SIGGRAPH papers/talks together
* Connect with researchers, professors, and industry guests in the graphics field
* Contribute to open source projects such as Blender

No prior experience needed — just an interest in graphics technology.

If this sounds like something you’d like to be part of, leave a comment or DM me so we can add you to our interest list. Once we gather enough people, we’ll hold an initial meeting.

Let’s bring a computer graphics community to UCSB!",UCSantaBarbara,0.83,Academics
Wanting to join Jazz Lab,"Hello! I am a freshman undergraduate at UCSB and I was looking to join the Jazz Lab. I missed auditions for the Fall 2025 quarter but I was wondering if it was possible to join in the Winter or Spring quarters. 

I've played the clarinet since 6th grade and have been in Wind Ensemble and Marching/Concert Band. I'm mainly joining Jazz Lab as I have not taken any jazz classes before and I would like to try it. 

I also didn't see any clarinet parts on the audition instructions. Are there any clarinets in Jazz Lab or would I have to switch to saxophone?

I will pay half your rent.,"Hello UCSB! 
  
    I signed the student housing contract and didn’t cancel it in time in time. (September 1 deadline). I called on September 3rd. Now I am sunk $2700 dollars of rent per quarter because I did not cancel my contract in time. This is a sunk cost. Right now i’m looking at just eating up the $8100 and thanking god that my parents aren’t murdering me for wasting $8100. Housing says the only way for me to be relieved of paying rent is to find someone to take over the bed space. 


    
   If anyone is willing to take over the bed space, I will pay half of the rent for the entire duration of the contract. This means instead of the remainder rent for the year ($7,425) you will only pay $3,712.50 dollars for the year.

   You will assume control of the contract and i will write you a check (or cash) for half of what is owed on the duration of your stay. (date dependent)

   Thanks if you’re interested DM me and I’ll send you my contact info. ",UCSantaBarbara,-0.43,Housing

I reviewed local coffee shops,"(This was made awhile ago so probably outdated… no longer in IV :,)

As a pretense, I’m not much of a coffee drinker. Evaluated based off taste, overall vibes, and study spot potential. Dune, Handlebar Coffee, The Arbor, &amp; Coral Tree Cafe I didn’t get to. 

1. Old Town Coffee Goleta
Iced lavender matcha latte: 8.5/10. I usually don’t love matcha, but this one I would order again. Docked off points for the rather tiny cup. All 5 ounces of it was yummy though. 
Ambiance: I originally rated the ambiance lower for the lack of lighting and AC, BUT I had failed to check out the entire cafe! This place deserves its 10/10 for vibes. There is not only abundant seating and charging outlets, there is a bar, ARCADE, pool, ping pong table, AND beautiful, sunny outdoor seating decorated with a fun hippie-like mural and string lights. Not to mention this place is open later than most other cafes I could find in Goleta/SB. I will be back… again, and again, and again!!! Playlist started out very western/country and later became more rnb/indie pop. Definitely some Still Woozy fans present. 

2. Kozy
Caramel latte blended: 9/10. I was pleasantly surprised
Ambiance: A cult favorite est. 2023. The pothos plants that brim the perimeter of this cozy cafe are beautifulllll. This place is fully equipped with AC, clean restroom, and fire playlist. You’ll find other students writing papers and chatting up Hinge dates. 9/10 for the easily lovable aesthetic. 

3. Kin Bakeshop
Strawberry milk: 9.5/10 This drink is delicious, light, fluffy and refreshing. Serving was small but I drank every last drop. 
Ambiance: This place is wonderful. Here you will find kind, hospitable workers, delectable sweet treats, exciting coffee, and aesthetic picturesque Pinterest vibes. It’s not really a place to sit, do work, or go to hang out for long, but it is a great place to stop by with a friend or date and enjoy a morning treat! There is usually a long line in the mornings, so be prepared to wait half an hour to a couple hours. Feel free to come later in the day if you don’t mind missing out on some of the most popular dessert items. Employees and customers alike were so sweet. 8/10 for this category only because I wish it was a place one could spend more time! 

4. Java Club 
Ghiradelli Mocha Blended: too sweet but what do you expect with a Ghiradelli mocha blended? If you want something less sweet order something else. It was yummy though I have an inkling the rest of the menu is delish. 6.8/10
Ambiance: 10/10 This place is beautiful, and I mean BEAUTIFUL. It is a CAFE!!!! I thought places like this went extinct, and if you think similarly, worry not, Java Club has got you. The vibe is earthy worldwide, but also fashionista American mom in 2002. If you know, you know. It looks like what Java Club sounds like, simply amazing. It can get warm in here, but there are ceiling fans and you can take off your freaking coat. Indoor and outdoor seating, some outlets and yes, wifi. They play Cigarettes After Sex. Ugh to listen to Apocalypse while doing work at an earthy cafe drinking a Ghiradelli mocha blended. This is life!!!! Also, I recommend checking out their comedy nights they are quite the vibe. 

5. Caje
Iced strawberry matcha: Very yummy, would recommend. Fruity and fresh. Only a dollar more for 8 ounces more so why not go for the large? Nice presentation too. 9/10
Ambiance: on a hot day I wouldn’t recommend sitting inside, feels stuffy but other than that lots of seating outdoors and it’s a great space to study or meet with a friend. Extra points for being in IV and open til 8pm. Minus a point for no restroom, like, is that even legal? 7.5/10

6. Dean
Vietnamese Iced Coffee: 8/10, it was soooo big and very yummy. It was actually so big I didn’t finish it. I was very energized, it did the trick.
Ambiance: 8/10 This place is the best work-type environment by far. It’s clean, minimalistic, has great lighting, and just feels easier to focus on because of its intentional choice of decor. Focus-inducing environment, only docked off points because your purchase buys 2 hrs of wifi

7. Dart
Iced Churro Latte with Almond Milk: 6.5/10, I don’t really taste the churro aspect of this churro latte… The drink itself is fine, but not a must have. It’s not too sweet and not too bitter. It has a slight cinnamon sugar flavor. It’s a light coffee drink. 
Ambiance: 8.5/10 This place is so colorfully &amp; beautifully decorated. Its ceiling is adorned with what must be a hundred lanterns and the shop is the perfect combination of cozy, bright, clean, and fun. The reason for the docked off points here is because this is not a spot meant for working, but perhaps that’s part of its charm. There are zero outlets available for customer use and this makes it challenging to spend more than two hours here with a laptop. If you want a spot to enjoy company with a friend, grab some caffeine or a bite to eat, or just enjoy a moment in a place that feels just so Santa Barbara, this spot is for you.",UCSantaBarbara,0.73,Social

My circumstances this year just spell disaster for me socially and I have no idea what to do. I don't know how I can survive this year without feeling miserable by the end because no one wants to hang out with me. I'd say I'm used to this feeling but recently it's been eating away at me.

If you click the link, which btw I don't think I've ever seen an official UCSB link that looked like the one in the email, it sends you to a google sites page that tells you to click another link to be redirected to the SSO page. If you look at the URL you can clearly tell that it is NOT the official SSO login page (I posted both URLs for reference \[the official one being sso.ucsb.edu\]).

I just wanted to know if this was true or not and how I could find parties and functions in the upcoming year when I do get to UCSB and if any other future transfers also like to party and go to raves!

Has anyone taken their landlord to court?,"My partner and I recently moved out of our IV apartment and were not given back our full security deposit despite keeping the place basically spotless. While some of our landlord’s claims for withholding money are valid, others are unjust. For example, it seems as if they charged us for repainting the entire apartment despite there being almost no damage to any paint (the only damage was one cabinet shelf). Compared to the rest of our complex, we moved out fairly late and it seemed as though they were repainting the entirety of every apartment, which makes us reason that this is normal procedure for every apartment after tenants move out, and we’re pretty sure they can’t charge us for if it’s routine. When we asked for evidence of damage and for itemized receipts, they provided photos that did not match the amount of work that they charged us for, and did not give any detailed receipts at all. We were only given an invoice for painting from the painter, and we were charged extra for having to paint the ceiling, however our landlord did not provide photo evidence of any damage to the ceiling, which would violate AB 2801 and civ. code §1950.5 if we’re not mistaken. Additionally, they charged us for cleaning that they themselves described as being normal wear and tear. After talking to the IV tenants union, we are considering small claims court and we would like to know if anyone has experience doing that, and how that went. 

TLDR: looking to take landlord to small claims for unjustified charges, any stories or experiences being in the same situation is appreciated",UCSantaBarbara,-0.43,Politics

Financial aid,Why is the financial aid office this year being so slow and just doing a shit job. I applied for an appeal which got approved a whole month ago and somehow not only did they take their sweet time giving me an award letter but when I opened it they gave me basically nothing. First year I paid out of pocket. Second year I had to drop my housing contract and find a place within a month and let’s not get started that before that I got scammed. Now third year the aid is bullshit. Each year they got me with some new shit as if they don’t want me to get this damn degree. Either way what was the whole point of an appeal if they’re still going to give me the left overs. I literally tell them I’m highkey homeless and they think it’s cute to give me so little. Not to mention i didn’t get a middle class scholarship as if I’ve got any damn money to my name. Let’s not even get started on the fact that they keep trying to get me to take out loans as if they’re going to pay for my shit. In this economy for an immigrant student that’s kind of the most stupid choice you can make. I’m not even going to have a job post graduation and they want me to get deep shit into student debt.

Some Bike Path Reminders,"Earlier today I almost got knocked off by bike while passing someone who was swerving in the lane, so here are a few reminders about common courtesy (especially for freshmen, but man do I know some people here who need to hear these).

1. Don't swerve and keep right. If you're passing someone, pass on the left and return to the right side of the lane as soon as you can. On a realted note, keep single file, it's near impossible to pass people riding tandem, especially during peak traffic. 
2. Call out when you're passing. It makes it easier to pass if they know you're there.
3. As a result of the last point, KEEP YOUR DAMN HEADPHONES OUT OF YOUR EARS. You need to be able to hear the world around you, you could seriously hurt someone. Hearing callouts is important.
4. Yeild to traffic already in the roundabouts. Last year I got ran off the road by someone who didn't yield, not a particularly pleasant experience.
5. Lastly, just pay attention. Knowing the above also means that you know when it's safe to break these principles, but you still need to know your surroundings.

As someone who tends to ride faster than traffic, PLEASE listen to help keep us all safe. I'm done ranting but as a closing note damn y'all really need to learn to ride a bike with other people nearby.

  
PS- Scooters please keep out of the damn bike racks: you're not even supposed to be allowed on campus. You're also not an exception to the above points, and honestly I could write a whole other post about all y'all.",UCSantaBarbara,-0.43,Housing

C CLIT 100 kinda annoyed,"Let me preface by saying I've never taken a literature course here so I don't know the norm. I was going to take this course because I wanted to take a C LIT course at UCSB, but the professor just sent out a message with everything we need for the course. Maybe it's because I've never taken a literature course here but I was kind of shocked. He's asking us to buy 5 different books that come out to around $70. Of course I can pirate it but he doesn't allow any electronics and stated that students must have the physical copy? i dont get why we cant just download the book and use it off our computer or ipads which most people have, and if not they can loan one from the school. Is this normal?? I've had to buy other school resources for chem, physics, and history classes which are inevitable but forcing us to buy the books when their are other means of getting them are kinda insane to me. I just don't get why we spend so much money for this school and then they drain us even more by having us buy extra resources for classes. So is this the norm for C LIT majors??

Empire Grade mishap: Person rescued after being found 50 feet down embankment near UC Santa Cruz,"Here's the report taken from the link:

A person was rescued over the weekend after they were found 50 feet down an embankment near the UC Santa Cruz campus, Cecile Juliette, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, told SFGATE.

Rescue crews were called to a cliff rescue just before 11 a.m. on Sunday, Juliette said. The person was on Empire Grade, a scenic, windy road that leads into the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains and is a well-known spot for strenuous bike rides. Cal Fire did not disclose if the person was hiking or biking up the road. 

It’s also unknown if the rescue was called in by the person who fell or by a bystander. When crews from Cal Fire, the Santa Cruz Fire Department, Santa Cruz Police Department and California State Parks eventually found the person, they were injured, Juliette said.

Rescuers used a rope rescue system and hoisted the person out of the terrain with a stokes basket, Juliette said. (A stokes basket is a stretcher made of metal wire or plastic and designed to keep the rescuee stable.) A photo from the Cal Fire Facebook page shows the rescuers from various agencies carrying the basket through rugged terrain.

A CALSTAR helicopter, which is a medical air service, was able to land next to the rescue and help “cut out ground transportation time,” Cal Fire said in its social media post. The person was subsequently transported to a local hospital for their injury, Juliette added.

"Post-breakup era, looking for cool people to hang with around UCSC","Hey everyone, I’m a 22-year-old UCSC student who recently got out of a long term relationship, and I’m trying to branch out and make some new connections.

Some details about the AWS outage on 10/20/2025 which affected Canvas,"Seattle-based Amazon said the problems were centered in its Virginia-based US-EAST-1 data center region, one of its most important cloud hubs around the world. The region is a backbone ""for so many services that when things go screwy, domino effects around the internet-as-we-know-it are enormous,"" wrote John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity researcher at Citizen Lab, in a social media post.

AWS traced the source of the problem to something called the ""DynamoDB endpoint in the US-East-1 Region,"" in a pair of jargon-laden updates.

""DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know, but it underpins the apps and services that all of us use every single day,"" said cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple.

DynamoDB is a centralized database service that many internet-based services use to track user information, store key data and manage their operations, Chapple said by email.

It's ""one of the record-keepers of the modern internet,"" said Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. ""It's fast, it's cheap, and it's reliable. But today it stopped working and we saw the effects of that outage ripple across the internet.""

""Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data. It's as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia,"" Chapple said.

Amazon has attributed the outage to a domain name system issue. DNS is the service that translates internet addresses into machine-readable IP addresses that connects browsers and apps with websites and underlying web services. DNS errors disrupt the translation process, interrupting the connection.

Because so many sites and services use AWS, a DNS error can have widespread results.",UCSC,-0.23,Finance

"UCSC Professor Refuses to Grade my Assignments, is There Anything I can do?","Hey all, 

I’m in a particular lower division course that I *need* to pass. My professor doesn’t use Canvas, and instead has us submit our work through Google Drive. There’s a big collective folder that we’re supposed to be submitting our work into, but for some reason, I don’t have access to this folder, and my professor is aware of that fact. We have tried to figure out how to resolve those issues but for one reason or another, we can’t.

Anyways, for now I’ve made my own folder and shared it with the professor, yet she has not graded any of my work since the quarter has started. I’m starting to get worried because I’ve been submitting everything on time and it’s hard to know how I’m doing in the class without any sort of feedback. The times I’ve tried to reach out to this professor over email to communicate my concerns. She has been cold and says that she doesn’t have the resources to help me right now. 

Is there anything I can do to get this professor to address my problems? Maybe a higher authority I can contact? Or general advice on how I can handle this problem? I have been working to the best of my ability in this course, I have been submitting everything on time- and it’s frustrating that I can’t hear any feedback on what I’m doing, and as it stands now, I am essentially failing this class, despite me doing literally nothing wrong.

Please help! ",UCSC,-0.53,Academics

Sophomore with trash GPA but actual research/projects - realistic shot at CUSC or nah,"Alright I need some brutal honesty here because idk if I'm delusional or actually have a shot.

**The Bad News First:**

* Sophomore at Gannon University (tiny school in PA nobody's heard of)
* 2.94 GPA... yeah it's rough
* Got a D in Physics, C- in Calc 2 because I'm apparently allergic to traditional classes
* My CS grades are good though (A+, A+, A-, A-, B-) so it's really just the gen eds killing me

**But also here's what I've actually been doing:**

**Research (3 projects):**

1. Self-correction mechanisms in LLMs - worked on getting models to actually fix their own errors
2. Malicious APK detection using ML - Android malware classification
3. IoT anomaly detection - security stuff for IoT devices

**Projects:**

* Built Lokus - a full knowledge management app with OAuth 2.0, Gmail integration, cross-platform (Windows/Mac), 68 AI tools built into an MCP server. Like I literally implemented the entire auth system from scratch with PKCE and everything
* HackHarvard 2025 - competed against MIT/Stanford/CMU kids. Built IRIS, an iOS app using LiDAR + AI pathfinding for blind navigation with haptic feedback. Judges from big companies actually wanted to connect after
* Some app I made has 10k+ users (can't say which for privacy but it's live and people actually use it)

**Other stuff:**

* President of CS club, took 8 students to HackHarvard
* Actually know how to code - React, Rust, Swift, Python, Java, not just leetcode grinding
* Working on reinforcement learning stuff, implemented PPO algorithms

**The Reality Check:** If I get 3.7-3.8 next two semesters, I'll end up around 3.4 GPA by transfer apps. Still mid but better than 2.94.

**My actual question:** Do schools like UIUC or Berkeley even look at people like me? Like yeah my GPA is trash but I'm literally doing the research and building the systems they teach. I'm not just some kid with good grades who's never built anything real.

Or should I be realistic and focus on:

* Arizona State (they have insane AI programs, #1 in innovation)
* Purdue (new AI major, solid CS)
* Northeastern (co-op program, good for someone who learns by doing)
* UC San Diego (new AI undergrad major)

**I guess my real question is:** Do top CS programs care more about GPA or actual demonstrated ability? Because I can show them 3 research projects, multiple complex systems I've built from scratch, and competition experience... but that 2.94 is gonna be on the transcript forever.

Am I wasting my time applying to reaches or do I actually have a shot with this profile?

Also if anyone's transferred into a top CS program with a similar situation PLEASE let me know how tf you did it.

UCB or UCSC as a psych transfer?,"I’m starting to apply for transfer this month for a psych BA and am torn between Berkeley and UCSC, given I’ll get accepted. I definitely want to eventually get a psych masters but I’m not decided on what I want to do with it yet - right now I’m in the mindset of child psychology. I really think I’ll get the most growth as a person at Berkeley, but I’m not sure all the “cutthroatedness” and “competition” would be good for my career in the long run. I’ve heard UCSC is a lot more of a friendly and laidback environment with more opportunities to get close to professors. I want to be as qualified as possible and get the most opportunities after college but I don’t want to exhaust myself and start hating psychology or ruin my mental health. Any advice?

Prospective Transfer From LA,"Hello! I am a CCC student from LA highly considering transferring to UCSC. I can tag there with my current GPA, but I am staying two more years at CC to do major prep and improve my grades, as well as get more involved via starting a club and engaging more with my honors society, tutoring, etc. I’ve visited UCSC and I loved the campus. 

There are only two issues for me, housing and the fact that there is no formal Comparative Literature major. If anyone is a lit major, pls comment because that’s kinda the only thing that holds me back and makes me still hold out hope for Berkeley and UCLA, and consider UCI. (Davis is way too hot.)

How do you guys fare with the housing, and how many people end up homeless? (I am dead serious about this question.) I am low income to be fully transparent, but I expect to take out loans and also save my pell grant distributions these last two years at CC to put towards uni.

Thanks so much! Hopefully I end up a plato-reading banana slug! 🤓",UCSC,0.73,Academics

What to do if Prof can't Teach? Aris PHYS 5D,"Aris. If you know him I needn't say more.

He's treating our INTRODUCTORY Physics class like an upper-div while also not teaching fundamental concepts. No Aris, not Vector Calc nor coding nor chemistry were prerequisites for this class. What are you on. Every single person I've talked to about the class hates it and doesn't understand (I am an A student!). He gives the most competent among us the yucky feeling that we're stupid when he hasn't taught us the things he expects us to know. Every lecture makes me even more of a Dhar apologist than I actually am to the point I feel relief and joy entering his 8am because of how rancid my tummy feels at 9:20 when Aris makes the entire class sit through 65 minutes of disjointed rambling that fails to teach the core methods necessary for the assigned work.

Is there some way to get the Physics department to audit our class? I hear he got banned from teaching Upper-Divs, and I honestly think he deserved it from how he's performed so far. Good grief. Obviously, I'll lock in and use the textbook to supplememt my learning, I'm not going to fail (despite taking 21 units), but dear lord I hope there's something we can do. I don't want to waste an entire quarter year on this class with Aris teaching it like he is.

If there's a way to have the Physics department make him get his shit together, or start using some pre-written curriculum, or replaced with someone else, or literally anything, that would be life-changing.

Don't talk to the RA. They are not your friend.,"I am speaking to this issue as a former RA. The student housing program requires RAs to chat with each resident, usually in-person chatting but can also be through email. The intent is to keep up with the residents and identify those who are in need of help or campus resources. You may hear about this under the names ""Intentional Interactions"" or ""One-on-one meetings"". These conversations can be logged in a google sheet that can be accessed by Student Housing staff. **Unfortunately, many RAs fail to disclose the fact that conversations with them are not private/confidential, let alone stored on the cloud.** Some students may want to befriend their RA and chat about sensitive information such as relationships, academics, or substance abuse. This information could very easily end up in the hands of housing supervisors or the conduct office. Even if you did nothing wrong, any misunderstanding from the housing staff (don't expect much from them) could lead to very real consequences involving your housing contract, student employment, or enrollment status. Obviously, the chance of this happening is 1%, but the impact said disaster is too great to ignore.

  
If you get messages from RAs claiming you are required to speak with them, you have the option to politely decline, per the 5th Amendment. 

  
Title is obviously dramatized (see on youtube ""Don't Talk to the Police""). I may sound a little crazy, but I speak from personal experience.  During my first year on campus, I only found out 6 months into living in the dorm that my RA had logged a good amount of our conversations and sent them to their CRE. Although there were no consequences, I felt violated by the lack of privacy and transparency in this process. 

When I left in 2024, it seemed like the Housing staff did not particularly care about this issue. Hopefully things are changing.",UCSC,-0.43,Politics

When I went to the financial aid office for the time they said they were still disbursing the money given and that I should wait until next week.

Its next week and still nothing. Thankfully the advisor was nice and told me to come in if the money hadn't arrived. Had to wait in line for over an hour just to get halfway. 

All this to say, I wanted to ask, should I worry about the housing and dining fees too much? Does anyone else have this issue? What should I do?

i have reached out to those on all floors of porter A and these are the photos from all 6 floors on the porter A dorm showers &amp; pipes. a woman in the porter A dorm 4th floor has been hospitalized and taken out her dorm room on a stretcher and diagnosed with lung disease after moving in on Saturday and being hospitalized by Tuesday. multiple people have reported headaches, skin rashes, sneezing &amp; respiratory issues. 
looking into this further it appears this has been an issue for quite some time. the RA’s said this has been an ongoing problem due to how old the building is and that years prior the same issues would arise. there is so much evidence of water damage on the ceilings and in one of the images a chunk has been painted over instead treating the issue. porter has one of the largest amounts of housing space with so many people that are at risk the longer we stay here. there are tons of people putting in fix it tickets but no action is being taken. a group of women got on their hands and knees trying to clean before their showers and now won’t take even lukewarm showers out of fear to reduce steam steam &amp; rumination.

"Hey CS majors, do you think I can stay under 45-50 hours of studying a week my junior year and receive an A?","Jr. year  
Fall: CSE13S, CSE107, CSE40  
Winter: CSE101, ECE30, CSE120  
Spring: CSE101M, CSE130, CSE114A

I know they say just take the units and multiply it by three but at the cc I just transferred from (also quarter system but its 12 weeks lol), that was not realistic at all because it seemed as though the professors made the courses easier (except physics). Is it accurate here? If so then 17x3 = 51 hours a week outside of class for fall, and 15x3 = 45 for winter and spring

I just transferred here and what I've heard from students who came from my cc is that the classes are substantially harder, so idk if my experience will guarantee I can handle it

I'm taking three CS courses a quarter because I wanted to free up my senior year so that I can have extra time to go above and beyond in my electives (like with projects outside of class) because that's where my career directly lies. Idk if this is a great idea but we'll see after this first quarter

My team from my summer internship really wants my help throughout the school year to complete their project, and I told them I'd try to do 10 hours a week (or up to 20 if possible). I know currently I burn out after programming/studying 55-60 hours a week so I don't want to make them any false promises/appear flakey",UCSC,-0.33,Academics

Psychology Major,"

Hello everyone,

I'm a CC student planning to transfer next fall, and I am going to major in psychology. While I'm open to all subfields, at the moment I think I'm leaning more towards cognitive and developmental. I am hoping to hear from students themselves who are currently studying psych or have in the past at UCSC, as I weigh all my options on which UC to transfer to.

Please feel free to share anything! All input is appreciated.

Some pointers:

* Thoughts on pacing/assignment load, work/life balance? (I haven't done quarter system)
* What challenges should a transfer student expect in the psych program?
* Are there opportunities for research or internships as an undergrad?
* How approachable are the faculty and advisors?
* Any tips for succeeding or standing out in the program?
* Rec. courses, maybe particularly useful for cognitive or developmental psych?
* What resources (clubs, tutoring, workshops) help students succeed in psychology?
* Overall experience at UCSC (pros/cons)",UCSC,-0.23,Academics

PSA Don't take the BCycle to class,"I know it looks like the perfect picture but after being here for years I can tell you it's not worth it. You will undock it and then head to class to only find out that all the docks are filled and you have to find 3 other stations to find one with a spot then walk a decent distance back to your actually class. 

Best case you check the app to see if it's full or empty then go and pray that nobody docks while you are on the way and you can get there under 30 minutes and not get charged overage fees. Maybe worth the stress or maybe not. 

The worst case is you get there and it's all full and you have to go to 3 different stations to find one with space, you go over your allocated time budget and get charged overage fees and then end up walking to class which would have been faster if you took the bus or walked directly depending on the trip. Ask me how I know that.

This post is a warning to everyone to stay away from Klesis Christian Fellowship. They are from Acts2 which used to be called Gracepoint, which used to be called Berkland. It's a high control group and once you get sucked in, they will end up controlling most of your life.

They will lure you with free food and instant friends. They have a ""Frosh Social and Night Market"" today. Please don't go. Or if you do go, don't give them your phone number or email address. Don't tell them where you live.

Be warned and do not join this group. For the first year, they will make it seem like it's all just fun and they just want to get to know you. They use love bombing to lure you to their group and then as the years pass, they will want you to spend most of your time, if not all, with this group and this group only.

my issue is that my two night classes. they are in the Kresge Academic Building which is roughly a 50ish minute walk. my first class starts at 5pm and my second classes ends at 8:45pm. i feel like i can manage walking to class but realistically i dont wanna walk around for almost an hour at night.

i would like to understand the loop bus system, because i tbh i don’t wanna always walk everywhere, but the maps link don’t work??? like on the TAPS website the link to the two maps just sends me back to the homepage.

### PRE-NOTE: I have the ""ucsc bus theorem"". It's pretty simple.

If the distance is less than 2 stops, if a bus isn't visible when you get to a bus stop JUST WALK 🙏. 95% of the time you will get there faster than the bus. For example JRL -&gt; Kresge, or Quarry -&gt; Crown.

Loop buses are box-shaped and **NEVER** articulated buses (the slinky ones). They say ""loop"" clearly on the top display sign.

Loop buses **do not run during the day on weekends!** Plan for this.  
\- Regular service is available 7:30am -&gt; 5:30pm.

Sometimes buses will say ""upper campus"". This means they basically just go back and forth from Oakes -&gt; main entrance.

If you are at Porter/RC and see a upper campus loop bus, it will take a **LONG TIME** to reach the campus entrance because instead of driving down empire grade, it will loop back through campus!

## City Bus: 18, 19, 11, 20

First of all, I don't recommend taking the bus to get around downtown Santa Cruz. It's a surprisingly bikeable city. Get the ebike membership (bcycle), ucsc subsidizes it. Anywhere left of the river is less than a 10-minute ride away.

The 19 buses travel **clockwise** around campus. 18 travels **counterclockwise**.

IMPORTANT: City buses do not necessarily LOOP back around to campus! They have a very long route that goes into the city, usually ends at Trader Joes.

So, if you are at Kresge and want to go to the gym, do not rely on the 18 to loop around and get you there!

Here is the full bus schedule: https://scmtd.com/en/routes/202610/11/wd

## General Transportation Tips

Unspoken rule, but if your destination is one stop away, just walk! Our campus has a very accessible ""school area"". Most lecture halls and locations are walkable and definitely bike able from each other.

The walking trails and beautiful routes between classes is one of the things I have enjoyed most about ucsc. It gives you a moment to cool off and think. So try and enjoy that instead of endlessly complaining about the bus schedule...

UCSC switched my housing from a quad dorm to an apartment last minute — anyone else?,"Hey slugs,

I just found out that UCSC changed my housing assignment for Fall 2025 *a few days before move-in*. I was originally supposed to be in a quad dorm, but they moved me into a College Nine apartment.

The thing is — I wasn’t prepared for this at all. I don’t know how to cook for myself, and I was counting on the dorm/meal plan setup. This feels really last minute and stressful. I already emailed housing asking if I can be switched back, but I’m not sure if they’ll accept.

Has this happened to anyone else? Do they ever actually switch people back, or am I pretty much stuck in the apartment? Any advice on what I should do would be appreciated.

Thanks, and good luck to everyone dealing with housing chaos 🙃.

**Update:** My original quad dorm assignment at College Nine was switched last minute to an apartment. When I contacted the housing coordinator, she was extremely rude to both myself and my mom.

PSA: Some Hwy 17 Express busses ONLY go to Scotts Valley now,"Per [SC Metro's new schedule](https://scmtd.com/en/metro-news-bulletins), Hwy 17 Express busses departing from San Jose Diridon Station at **6:40 AM, 7:30 AM, 1:20 PM, and 3:20 PM** will ONLY go to Scotts Valley and WILL NOT go to Santa Cruz. The bus will say ""Hwy 17 Express to Scotts Valley via Scotts Valley Dr"".

Note that this only occurs on weekdays. All 17 busses go to Santa Cruz on weekends.

To connect to Santa Cruz on these buses, you will need to transfer to the 35X. (If you do not have a student ID, ask the 17 bus driver for a transfer to Santa Cruz.) While this is supposed to be a ""timed"" transfer, the bus is usually late, so you'll probably have to wait about 10 minutes. **On average, this will add an additional 25 minutes to your trip.**

This makes all but the 1:20 PM bus irrelevant, as you might as well just hop on the next 17 to Santa Cruz and get there at about the same time.

I've been trying to figure out some stuff since 12 and pulled up into a quiet room... and like 20 minutes later a group of two came in. I muted my mfing YouTube video and put on NOISE CANCELING headphones to be polite and quiet in a common study area.

They were studying fine until about 40 minutes later when she starts with that drawl voice and he's like loud whispering???

""Omg am I fattttt I feel like my face is rounderrrr""

""Omg my ex did blah blah blahhhh""

""Stawppp omg nooo do I have a double chin be honestttt""

HOLY SHIT MAN, go somewhere else without tweakin students being subjected to hearing 10 minutes of you needing to lose weight and getting back in the gym when you're as thin as a twig and learn to control your volume, there's no reason why it should penetrate through my headphones. 

I get there's no clear rules about remaining low in these common areas, but have some common decency when you see other looking crazy and hunched over!! I came here for quiet cause my suite is too loud!

Gen BBQ UTC: Terrible Management and Disrespect Toward Employees,"
I have a roommate who applied at Gen Korean BBQ, and their management practices explain exactly why the place struggles. They hire managers who seem completely untrained in actual management. Employees are told not to clock in even when arriving on time for their scheduled shift, simply because there are no customers yet. Shifts get canceled constantly with no regard for workers’ time or income. It sounds like an awful place to work.

Hopefully this reaches their corporate office. Invest in better management and respect your employees. Customers already have plenty of complaints about this location. UTC is not a rundown area, so stop running the restaurant like it is.

Does it get better here?,"Sorry if this is formatted wrong, I dont ever usually interact with anything online that is public bc of anxiety but I genuinely need to hear from some upperclassmen. Im a freshman at ucsd and since deciding to attend I feel like the school has done nothing but make me feel like they didn’t want me to actually accept. I have severe social anxiety to the point where I spent a large portion of my childhood unable to leave the house on my own. Despite this being very well documented, the Osd randomly ghosted me despite multiple calls and emails leaving me completely on my own in a triple dorm. Additionally, I have been on an anti-anxiety medication for years and almost had to go through withdrawals because the campus pharmacy would not respond to my requests to send my medication there. I live in a near constant state of anxiety because of how little privacy I have(resulting in me waking up constantly throughout the night) and have been showering multiple times a day just so my roommates wont hear me cry. On top of that I have a lot of uncommon food allergies and have had several scares with dining hall food to the point where Im forced to cook everything myself. Every place I reach out to sends me to someone else, and it feels like they don’t actually want to help and just want to get rid of me. I know I struggle to make friends and I was prepared for some level of isolation, but I haven’t had a word spoken to me in weeks and I somehow feel as though Im both too surrounded by people and too isolated? The whole reason I picked this school was for the quality of classes, but I am finding all the material to be shallower and easier than the stuff I learned in high school. In short im miserable and feel like Im not even getting the education I wanted to show for it. Does it get easier? Will my classes become more rigorous? I would love to hear from students with a few more years under their belt because Im finding it hard to make myself stay here.

"""Should I do my MS/PhD/etc in A or B or C or.....""","I see this question a lot and it is a totally smart thing to ask, but reddit is the last place you should ask it.

If this is you, go find 5 PIs who work in the realm you're considering and ask them what they would have an extra pair of grad student hands/eyes work on, if they magically had an extra F grant to pay them. *Everyone* has a list of projects or open questions they'd like to tackle if they had the bodies to throw at it, and generally they'll know the kind of skillset they would look for in the person who could succeed at it. You can roll the dice with abstract insight as people talk about ""where the field is going"" but:

A) expect all your peers to have heard the same thing so it is not beneficial to you as one person in a competitive group,

B) people don't really get hired by the field, they get hired by PIs and lab managers, and

C) the NIH is being dismantled by Nazis, meaning the competition is going to radically ramp up. Departments will likely cut their intakes or switch to admitting every other year (or both), multi-year grants have to be funded in lump sums so they're gonna be way harder to get, etc. It's dark and you will need to be agile about it.",ucsd,-0.73,Academics

Full-Time vs Flex Evening MBA (Using GI Bill) — What’s the Real Difference?,"I’m deciding between the **Full-Time MBA** and the **Flex Evening MBA**, and I’m using the **GI Bill** to cover tuition.

For those who’ve done either program —

* What would you recommend?
* What does the **class schedule** actually look like (how many days/class sessions per week)?
* Do you get **summers off**?

From what I’ve heard:

* The **Flex Evening** requires **summer classes** if you want to finish in \~2.5 years.
* The **Full-Time** program can be done in about **21 months** and may have **no summer classes**.

I consider myself somewhat extroverted and I went to at least 1 welcome week event every day in week 0, but i still somehow have no friends. I keep talking to people and then they never respond or follow up on plans, and I don't want to keep chasing after people who, in all honesty, don't really seem that keen on being friends. I'm trying my best to be positive but it's just getting hard as I see all my suitemates making friends so easily, and I don't want this to come of in the wrong way, but I was literally the one who went up to people and introuced all of my suitemates and whatnot to other groups when out and about. My point is that nobody really comes up to me if that makes sense, it's just  so defeating that I have to keep chasing people and nothing ever comes out of it, and I've been to a few club things but it's the same way. I really felt it yesterday which is why I'm posting now ig lol, but all of my suite mates were out with their own friends and there I was just sitting in bed on my phone alone, and then when I went out to get some air everybody was with their friends.

PhD in Bioinformatics & Systems Bio with a BMI Track vs Biomedical Sciences with a Concentration in Bioinformatics,"To give some context, I have a background in general biology (so courses covering biochem, ecology and evolution, molecular genetics, neurobiology, etc) and a minor in statistical science. I feel like my computing background is limited because I only took one programming in biology course run by the biology dept, not CS. I've taken Calc 1, 2, 3, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and am currently doing statistics/probability theory. I have yet to take stochastic processes, but what I'm concerned about is that the UCSD bioinformatics PhD program (even the BMI track that I'm interested in) seems to be very CS-heavy and requires background in data structures and algorithms, which I don't have. However, I watched the 2023 admissions video and some of the students said that basic familiarity with CS is adequate, so if anyone has more insight, I'd appreciate it.

GSRs and ASEs...how much parental leave did you get?,"The union contract language is quite vague. I've pasted the language in the contract related to parental leave. My university says I get 8 weeks total because the qualifying event is the birth. The union claims its not one leave per birth. They say that I am eligible for 8 weeks of leave in consecutive academic years for the same birth as long as I am taking leave to care for a child who is less than 12 months old.

I am curious...

a) how much parental leave did you get as an ASE or GSR if you took leave since 2022?

b) how do you interpret the wording in the contract?

**D. LONG-TERM LEAVE**

1. Leave Eligibility  
Salaried ASEs who take a leave pursuant to Section D.2 shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of paid leave per academic year.

2. Upon request from an ASE and subject to the provisions of this Article, the University will grant an ASE’s reasonable request for long-term leave due to:

b. To care for and bond with the newborn child or a child placed with the ASE for adoption or foster care, provided that the leave is taken within twelve months of the birth or placement of the child with the ASE",ucsd,-0.2,Academics

⚠️ Safety Alert — Suspicious Person Near La Jolla Village (US Bank / Urban Plates Area),"Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share something I saw this morning around 7:30 AM near the US Bank ATM in La Jolla Village.

There was a guy dressed in all black, wearing a Scream mask, carrying a backpack, skateboard, and what looked like steel cables. He walked into the Urban Plates patio, which is closed until 11 AM. The whole thing felt really off — especially at that hour.

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him around. The last time was around 10:30 PM near Ralphs in the same area. He was wearing the same outfit and mask, with both hands in his pockets, walking between cars and hiding behind them like he was trying not to be seen. It really creeped me out.

I just want to remind everyone — especially students and people walking alone — to stay aware of your surroundings. We’ve all heard about the recent incident with a man in a lion mask at La Jolla Shores attacking someone, so please be careful out there.

Stay safe, everyone.

"What is the undergraduate limit for double majoring, 200 or 400 credits?","I suspected my stepson never got into graduate school at UCSD...he was an undergraduate there since around 2017. Extremely secretive person to the point of being psychotic. Begs his mom to let him double major in Physics. Then last year, he says he's done with undergrad and is taking PhD courses online. I have no idea when he actually last set foot on campus physically. One of those stay in his room 24/7 in a bathrobe people. He hasn't taken a campus class physically since before Covid hit. His mother was so happy he got accepted. Well...not so fast, see below. 

So yesterday I go on a mountain bike group ride, one of the riders is a PhD math student. I say my stepson is also in the program and taking online classes. He says there are no online graduate classes in math. He then looks up the student's name on the graduate directory...it's missing. I text my wife that we need to talk about this. She confronts him and he does admit that 'technically' he's not in the PhD program yet. 

Here is his plan and please tell me how whacked out this is, or if it could actually work: UCSD allows 5.5 years or 200 credits before forcing graduation (or kicking them out). If he double majored, I assume that's 11.0 years and 400 credits? He's been there since 2017 so he has until 2028 to finalize everything? He'll be 33 years old in 2 months BTW... Graduate school is $20K a year. His plan is to take as many PhD courses as he can (if he is indeed really taking ANY of them online) as an undergrad who as a scholarship and doesn't pay for classes. If he can take two years of classes and get those out of the way, and pass the qualifying exam, then in theory he only has two years left for a dissertation and he saves $40K for not having to pay for four years. 

IMO it's a really f-ed up way to go about trying to save $40K. If it works, and he gets his PhD and actually moves out and gets a postdoc somewhere, all will be more or less forgiven. I personally think it will not work; first of all he never even applied for the program and there is no guarantee he will be accepted. He does have other offers in Texas and Florida as a backup (out of state tuition of course). 

Can he really take most/all of his PhD classes still enrolled as an undergrad? And are any graduate classes online, especially in math?",ucsd,-0.75,Academics

Just Stressed,"I lowkey have no one to vent to so I’m just going to vent here. Ever since I started uni, I have been stressed. It’s my first year so obviously it’s going to be an adjustment and I don’t feel homesick because I’m commuting. But, academically, I have never been so stressed in my life and that’s coming from someone who excelled in high school. And the crazy part is that I’m not even taking what is considered hard classes or even taking 16 credits. I’m taking 12 so I could get used it and I am ahead due to taking dual enrollment in high school. But, I’m constantly drained and I never feel like I’m doing enough. And it’s the constant anxiety because all I want to do is pass. It’s crazy and I feel like I’m going crazy. Whenever I’m in class I’m so locked in and then I look around and people are just having convos or on their phones like are they just crazy smart? I am struggling and my major is also known to not be that hard, it’s cogs sci spec. in neuro. I just am so stressed right now. I literally wake up with my heart pumping with anxiety! My dad told me that the first year is going to be the hardest and now I understand why. But, I feel so guilty for feeling this way because there’s people working a job and taking harder classes or doing a harder degree in general and here I am complaining. Is it normal to feel this way? Any advice? Like things you did to not feel this looming sense of doom and despair and just misery 😭?",ucsd,-0.43,Mental Health

He talks so quietly I can barely hear him even in the front row, and he rushes through every single slide like it’s a race.

Then he had the nerve to ask, “was the midterm too hard?” Sir… yes. Yes it was.

I’m honestly planning to email him because something needs to change. If you guys feel the same, please email too — maybe if enough of us say something, they’ll actually adjust the pacing or SOMETHING.

 a few times now people will skid past with their foot swiping my cane out. no spatial awareness, and sometimes it feels purposeful as if they have a early 2000s movie bully complex. ive even had some guy near the walk path towards target 2 weeks ago (black hoodie with red bird on it, i saw you man.) push me to the ground on purpose.

no spatial awareness, even in a slow chatty walk. i have a brain disease that affects my equilibrium, vision, and proprioception by a lot, and even i  can navigate and accustom accordingly. what is their excuse? genuinely? ",ucsd,-0.83,Mental Health

Want to join a pre-health/pre-nursing organization on campus that is not overpopulated compared to others?? Join PRENSA...PRENSA stands for ""Pre-Nursing Student Association"". We guide and shed light on a community of pre-nursing students here at UCSD. You don't necessarily have to be pre-nursing; we invite anyone with pre-health interests. We host GBMs, socials, volunteer, internships, and more opportunities. Our main goal for this year is giving back to the UCSD and San Diego community by doing more hands-on work. Whether that is making care packages for the homeless, care packages for UCSD students, or taking trips to Tijuana to volunteer at clinics there as well. This may be a great opportunity for you if you're looking for a pre-health organization that is not as populated as others, making it more likely for you to gain experience. Most of our board members have certifications such as CNA, MA, and Med Tech...we guide out members on the path of getting certifications that you can have before expanding your education post bachelors. Get hands-on clinical experience by letting us mentor you on where to get your certification, what places to apply, and more. Through collaboration, mentorship, and advocacy efforts, members will enhance their understanding of the healthcare field, promote a commitment towards compassionate care, and support each other’s journey towards becoming empathetic healthcare professionals with obtained knowledge, insight, and information surrounding the field of nursing.

  
At our first GBM you will find out about a volunteer opportunity for this Sunday 10/26 &amp; an upcoming social event! 

FIRST GBM TUESDAY 10/21 TOMORROW @ CENTER HALL 

ROOM NUMBER WILL BE DISCLOSED 45MIN BEFORE GBM STARTS @ 6:30PM ON OUR INSTAGRAM!!

The faces of UCSD diversity - throwback 2010,"The one dude’s post about his treatment as a black student reminded me of this. 

Story time: Back in Feb 2010 the infamous Compton cookout happened. Around that same time, one of the assistant athletic directors asked me to go do a photoshoot to increase visibility for UCSD Athletics. Being the vain mofo I am, I was down. 

For some reason I decided to show up in these terrible ass 2000s extra long jean shorts. Don’t judge me. Baggy was in back then. Maybe it wasn’t. Idk. 😂😂😂

Anyways I don’t know if it before or after the cookout, but around that time this young lady and ai became the faces of diversity at UCSD. 

This picture showed up in every other article about UCSD for probably 2 years. 

Also shoutout to the dude on the bike. I think he was on the tennis team or fencing team. ",ucsd,-0.23,Athletics

When I looked up the ucsd requirements to be eligible for 2 years of guaranteed housing the requirements are that you have to live on campus your admitted year which I did.

Is anyone down to be friends? (SERIOUS)(psychology major UCSD),"READ FULLY PLEASE: 

Hey everyone! I’m a psychology major at UCSD, and this is my last year here. I’ve been a bit shy and haven’t really put myself out there as much as I should have. I’m not looking to be best friends with anyone, but I’d love to make some cool friends before I graduate. I’d love to hang out with people I can actually be friends with outside of UCSD. I’m a female, so I’d love female friends! Males are okay too, as long as you’re really cool and not weird. I’m a transfer student, which is part of the reason why it’s been so hard for me to put myself out there. I don’t really commute often, but I’ve been feeling a little lonely. I’m a big fan of trying new things and exploring new places. I’m thinking of going on some hikes around here, and I’ve always been interested in trying “extreme” activities that would probably make most people SH**T themselves. Basically, I don’t want to be friends with anyone who’s too scared to live their life. I get scared too, but I want to meet friends who will challenge us to step outside our comfort zones. Of course, there will be boundaries at first, but I really want to meet friends who are as adventurous as I am (YOLO). Another thing I’ve been wanting to do is go to HHN. I’ve been there before, but it wasn’t as much fun because no one made me feel comfortable enough to be there with them. I really want to have a friend who we can laugh together all night long. I’m a bit weird, but in a really good way… I’m not looking specifically for a psychology major friend, but it would be preferred just because I struggle sometimes in school, and having a friend in that major would make me feel more sane. 

Something I’d like to mention though is… I’m the type of person who sometimes needs a little space, so there might be times when I don’t respond right away or even go a couple days without texting. Please don’t take it personally! It has nothing to do with me not liking you or not wanting to be friends, I just get really focused or overwhelmed with school/life and accidentally go quiet. That being said, I’m still serious about making real friendships. We don’t have to talk every single day to be close, but if we do end up clicking and talking all the time, I’m totally down for that too. I just wanted to put it out there so no one feels ignored or unappreciated. I value quality over constant texting, and I love friendships where we can pick up right where we left off, and still go on fun/adventurous plans together.",ucsd,-0.23,Academics

Structural Engineering / Engineering Clubs: Advice Needed,"First yr and faced w rejections from the bigger eng clubs on campus, I was looking for advice on what I should do.

 Ik there is always next year but if I get rejected solely based on my resume and answers to questions, I would most likely need more/better experiences to talk about?

  
Any opinions, advice? I want to actually learn stuff that could then help me land a job/internship later on.",ucsd,-0.33,Academics
