        "body": "hi, i don't mean to join the sea of posts complaining about this specific topic but coming in as a transfer student seems absolutely miserable. my biggest fear going to a big college was that it'd be just like community college where i didn't really get to know too many people until i was like, already moving. for context i have had one friend group that started in middle school and has stuck together through online outlets like discord and instagram. i love those people dearly, they're the life in my veins that pushes me to keep going. but i would like to meet new people.\n\nmy orientation went great and i loved hanging out with the people there, but we didn't stick as well as i'd hoped and i've barely talked to any of them since. my next bet was to talk to people from my classes, which i did to some extent. however, they became more like work acquaintances than real frends. so, naturally, i went to clubs, namely the guitar club since i have been interested in learning guitar. when i went, though, i was surrounded by pre-established friend groups of 2-4 people who had been going already. outside of the icebreaker i never opened my mouth there. maybe that's my fault for not going out of my way to talk to people, i don't know. seeing as that wasn't working, i stopped going.\n\nthis is all happening while i live in a double with my roommate, who seemed to get along with the other people in our building just fine, though all my efforts to get close with them were fruitless. i feel isolated in my own home of all places.\n\nit just felt like every time one of my efforts failed, i'd try something else, only to be shot down again. the last time i tried to talk to someone, it was in the memorial union outside the little snack spot they have there. i got myself some crappy gummies and ate on one of the tables nearby. sitting in the table in front of me was someone with a bag of spicy doritos, interestingly they folded the bag up when they were done. i thought that was really funny for some reason so i wanted to ask why they did it. but they were just on their phone for a long ass time. i ended up leaving, ashamed i never talked to them due to shyness... i turned my head to see what they were doing on their phone, and lo and behold do i see the iphone control panel. i guess maybe i was making them uncomfortable, and they were using their phone because they didn't want to talk to me.\n\nthen i just had a mental break. not like a violent, crying one, but just a silent rage type of one. i went on amazon and ordered an electric guitar and amp. if i'm not spending my time socializing, then i'll just embrace being isolated and fuck off to practice elsewhere.\n\nwhat's shocking to me is all my life, people have been telling me \"you'll meet your people in college.\" so where are they? i'm here and i've never felt lonelier in my entire life. just really feels falsely advertised, lol.\n\nsomeone made a post a couple days ago about how all the days seem blurred together. i feel like i couldn't relate more. every day just feels like i'm going through the motions because i have to, but the force that makes my legs move gets weaker by the day. i've never wondered \"what's the point?\" as much as i have now. it helps to know i'm not the only one at least\n\ni'm not really making this post for advice on what to do, rather i just want to evoke a similar feeling as the other person's post did; you are not alone. i'll get this damn degree even if i have to do it out of spite and through an isolated struggle. i don't care, i just need to get out of here as fast as possible."

He then started walking toward downtown. \n\nI informed UC Davis police about it. Running at people full speed like that is not fucking funny. \n\nI want to let people know about it. I biked alongside him for a minute, didn’t see any weapons or anything. Just a punk. "

Ideally, I would be able to meet people who have at least some shared interests like gardening, writing, hiking, and the like.\n\nAnd if you’re in a similar spot and open to meeting up, feel free to DM me and we can chat to see if we could potentially be a good fit!"

Or any advice as to how to approach someone? She was a bookseller with pins on her lanyard? I think it was a space or solar lanyard and it had an id hanger. I appreciate any advice on how to start a conversation "

I submitted my change of major petition a week ago after attending the change of major workshop. This week, one of the ECE advisors reached out to me asking me to submit an excess unit petition since I've reached 140.5 units (13.5 of them were from community college classes I took) and anyone who wants to switch majors after hitting 135 units needs to submit that petition and the way the advisors were talking about it made it seem like there was a chance it could get denied.\n\nI already filled out the petition and sent it back to the advisors. I followed up and asked more about it and they were saying that I would probably have to wait until December before I can fully switch my major because that's when the UGEP committee meets. What can I do to make sure that this petition gets approved? Because I heard if it gets denied then that would mean I can't switch majors and there's nothing I can do. All of the classes I have taken so far would count towards the EE/CE double major or the CS minor and I have close to a 4.0 GPA. I just went 5 units over that 135 unit threshold. \n\nI know I might be worrying too much but I really don't want to continue with CSE and I really want to do stuff with hardware and electronics. I've heard that most of those petitions get approved especially because college of engineering doesn't have the unit cap but I'm genuinely kind of worried about what I'm going to do if it gets denied."

        "body": "Hello friends, if you are considering living in Tanglewood@Davis, please avoid this place at all your cost. \n\nTLDR: \n1. Threatened to kick us out because we said no pre-moveout carpet inspection, even though it is agreed on paper previously and signed by me, my roommates, and the leasing office. Picture attached in this review.\n2. Charged us almost $2400 after we move out for “wear and tear” in addition to $1100 deposit\n3. We paid rent + utility timely the first day of EVERY month, still charged $550 extra after move out cuz “we did not pay for utility for the last 3 months of stay”.\n4. Some people in management team are very passive aggressive during communication. \n\nAttached pics: \n1. Letter to kick us out if we don’t give permission for inspection \n2. Original repair invoice after we move out \n3. Corrected repair invoice \n\nHere’s the longer story if you wanna kill some time \n\n1. Me and 2 other friends lived here 9/23-9/25. 6 months before we moved out, we signed a document with the leasing office, saying we do not want any pre-moveout inspection because all of us will be gone during summer and will not have time to clean up before the pre-moveout inspection. In 7/25, which is 1.5 months before our official move out date, we received a notice stocked on our door saying the leasing office will do pre-move out carpet inspection in 3 days. Mind you non of us were in Davis, the only way we found out about this is because my partner was grabbing some stuff from my room and saw the notice. We argued with the manager, Kyra, who said the leasing office had every right to enter our apartment since they put out the notice 72 hrs in advance. The next day, fulling aware none of us were in Davis, she put another notice on our door, threatened to kick us out if we do not give permission for the inspection. We reminded them multiple times that we already signed a document 6 months prior saying we do not want any inspection. Eventually they gave in. \n\n2. After move out, they charged us $2400 extra outside of $1100 deposit. The carpet and vinyl were already 9 years old, which is approaching the use limit (they change all the carpet and vinyl every 10 years). Despite approaching use time limit, they charged us FULL AMOUNT for vinyl replacement. We argued with leasing office for almost a month before they got back to us and correct the invoice. \n\n3. Charged us $550 extra for the last 3 months of utility before we move out because “we did not pay”. However, we paid rent and utility timely on the first day of every month. After showing them screenshots, they still deny the mistake. Called them, I was on the phone for 30 minutes with a guy, explaining that we were charged extra and they need to fix the invoice, but the person didn’t know what’s going on and was trying to convince me that we did not pay. \n\n4. The whole process of communicating with the team back and forth was EXTREMELY frustrating because they will not admit their mistakes. After arguing with them a whole months, they finally agreed to correct the invoice and gave our deposit back. I cannot imagine how many tenants they have charged extra after moveout and how much money they made off people who do not have the habit of arguing with the leasing office. "

I feel I would benefit greatly from having some sort of way to relieve stress surrounding making sure I get the classes I need to take, and being able to take them in a relatively favourable time (ie I have a tendency to do worse later in the day because my social battery can only get me so far). One of my childhood friends was saying I should talk with the SDC to see if there's anything they can do like moving my pass time up enough to guarantee a large chunk of my classes are earlier or spaced well enough to prevent unnecessary stress. I call it stress but it genuinely feels like I'm dying at random intervals and it's starting to interfere with my classes and sleep. I will take any help or suggestions at this point so do any of you have experience with this? And if the SDC can't do anything, is there a way you've overcome or combatted this kind of anxiety?"

Yesterday I got an email from my supervisor that she said I need to stop training because DMV stop issuing CDL to foreigner (who do not have PR card or not a US citizen). That means I cannot be a bus driver because I'm not able to get CDL from DMV. I searched some news about that probably because the bad crash happened in Florida. The driver is an illegal immigrant from India. (So FTA asked all state DMV to stop issuing CDL to foreigner?) Anyway, I real love this job and I have spent lots of time on the DMV pre-trip and training. Is there anyway or anyone I can contact to know more information that I can get CDL or apply an exception. By the way, UCDavis Unitrans is a really good company, they are willing to offer me another job position and let me back when I able to get a CDL from DMV! I'm really appreciate that. "

I had a hard time letting go of my parents. they kept telling me id do great and they're so proud of me. the last thing i wanted was to drop my arms from them and feel theirs drop from me and watch them drive away. trying to recall the first few days seems so strange and unfamiliar, like that was never actually a part of my timeline. Just events in my head that dont make any sense at all. \n\none of the first people who tried to talk to me was a drunk guy who followed me home from a party. party itself was extremely dull. i saw people around me having a good time. i was trying to have a good time too but it felt impossible. dude saw me standing by myself and told me he was going to leave with me. it was entertaining until i couldn't go back to my dorm because he was so set on coming back with me. i watched him puke on the sidewalk like 4 times before i finally convinced him to text his roommate to come pick him up.\n\norientation was so bleak as well. i tried talking to people but it seems like i just wasn't what they were looking for. they were more interested in each other.\n\nsince classes have started everything has just felt the same. i still dont have the stupid roads memorized here because everything feels chaotic and pointless. i sometimes go a whole day without opening my mouth because i dont have anyone to talk to. the past few weeks have blended into a single memory of giant ceiling lights and back pain and the image of the back of everyones heads. i dont know what to do next. i wish i could take a nap that was heavy enough to fix all of this."

I went to the old version lots of times, before the UMall closed in 2023.\n\nWhen I got there, I didn't see the Beef Bowl combo ($14.95) they had on their online order website. There was an $18.99 version though. I decided to go for the $12.99 crispy chicken combo instead. I picked medium spiciness, out of mild-medium-hot. \n\nThe chicken came out first, a few minutes before the tea. Some notes:\n\n*  It was unseasoned. Not just un-spicy, unseasoned (not even salt), like they forgot to season it. I checked my receipt, it said \"medium\", so it couldn't have been an ordering error. There didn't seem to be any \"add your own seasoning\" station either, so it wasn't that.\n* It was not hot, only somewhat warm. \n* It was a bit soggy.\n* Came in a paper bag, not a box. (I'm guessing because they just opened, no boxes yet?)\n\nThe chicken was definitely a far cry from what it used to be, or what iTea/Raretea/anyplace else offer.  I guess it had been sitting a while. Especially since it had no seasoning, not good.\n\nThen the tea came. I got the House Boba Milk Tea, not bad! Notes:\n\n* Good strong tea flavor, similar to what I remember.\n* Nice tall size.\n* Good boba texture.\n* I ordered 25% sweetness - perfect. Not too sweet.\n\nOther general notes\n\n* Nice staff! Clean place. I like the flowers.\n* The music was uncomfortably loud.\n* No kiosk ordering\n* Only a few tables inside. The old place was kinda like this, but even fewer.\n\nOverall, I'm not planning to go back for a while. I know it will get better as they get back into their groove."

Perfect, less strain on my family, perfect. \nNow I wake up, and it's saying $2,000 PLUS by November 15. Who can pay that? Can you imagine ? \nMy friend suffered a medical emergency last year, intense vertigo and hospitalized right before finals. She took an incomplete and now she faces financial aid cuts and medical bills I don't understand. She's talking about dropping out and going to CSU. I don't know what to think anymore. \nWhy doesn't this university help people? How can anyone drop a charge like that on someone and just expect them to find it in their email? I feel crushed. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. My mom is all I got, and we can't afford this. Not this year. She's working hard to pay off a lawyer. I was so happy when I showed her my $88 dollars a month. Felt like I did my part. \nHow can they do that, tempt someone into thinking they earned a four year degree, that life outside the forgetten parts of LA is at all possible? Kicked in the teeth by a boot, that's what this feels like. \nWhat the hell can you do, I'm going to the Financial Aid office and figuring it out. If I have to take out a loan, god forbid, I'll figure something out. The U.S, California, UCs, and especially UC Davis hate to see brown children live their dreams. "

Accordingly, widespread research software growth has included emerging roles for people who create, maintain, and contribute to the research software ecosystem. These roles can bring value directly through enabling specific research projects. They also bring value indirectly, through helping ensure enduring impact of research software innovations and by facilitating adequate reproducibility standards in digital science.\n\nOur group is looking for students that either want to become a research software engineer or want to improve their software development skills.\n\nWe have activities for students that are able to commit large or small amounts of time.\n\nRespons or DM me if you are interested."

He had it parked in the bike parking lot between 5019 and 5017, right in front of the door to 5017 and a security camera. He had an orange Kryptonite U-Lock securely attached to the frame and bike parking.\n\nWe came out around 8am to go shopping, only to find his U-Lock on the ground sawed in half. Then, a man (shout out Kendrick) came up asking if we had lost a bike. He proceeded to tell us that around 4am he heard an angle grinder and an awful smell coming from the bike parking lot. Then he took this video about an hour later, and  confronted the guy trying to load the bike into his truck. He said he was able to wrestle the bike away from the guy, scare him off, and turn it into the police. This dude was an actual saint, thank you kind stranger. \n\n  \nWe're still waiting on any possible security camera footage, but not particularly hopeful on the thief being identified by the police. \n\nJust wanted to share for anyone who also parks in the area. Even with the \"best\" lock, if a thief really wants your bike they will get through it, and most people will not be so lucky to have an angel like Kendrick descend upon Orchard Park and save your bike. Stay safe out there everyone. "

I sent a ticket to IT about this, but they're closed on the weekend so I'm afraid of my account will be automatically closed before they get to my ticket.

I currently have a 3.47 GPA.

If you can rehome them, please help us sharing this information!! \n\nWith a lot of pain in my heart, I'm posting because I need to rehome my 3 chinchillas. I'm a grad student, I need to move out of my place, and it would be irresponsible to keep the chinchillas with me, probably without being able to provide the care they need. And as I love them so much, I want to give them the chance to find a home that can provide the care they deserve. Of course, if people need the enclosures and all their supplies and toys, they can take them.\n\nThe dad was rescued from a really abusive house, and his two kids were born on Feb of 2024. Unfortunately, their mom passed away when they were only a few days old and we bottle fed them until they were happy and healthy. The two boys live in an enclosure (dad and son), and the girl lives in her own enclosure:\n\n\\-Pierre Jean-Jacques (1st picture): The dad. He can be grumpy, and he can try to soft bite you if the reason of interaction is anything different than food. But he is the greatest dad ever and after the baby's mom died, he would protect them, groom them, and caress them. And in a good day, he can get some pets in between running sessions (oh! he loves to run, run and run... in their wheel). Note: Pierre was seriously neglected, he got cataracts, and he missed a couple of toes. Nonetheless, last time the vet checked him (at UC Davis Small Animals clinic) they said Pierre was healthy. They believe he is 8+ year old. When I rescued him, he would not let anyone approach the cage, he used to bite everyone and used to pee all over the walls. We made a huge progress, and with his son, he has seemed a lot more active and open to humans.\n\n\\-Luigi Salvatore (aka. Lou-Lou, Lou) (2nd picture): Lou is sweetheart. He loves food and he loves pets. He is by far the biggest (same size as his mom). He likes to run and likes to jump around the different levels of his enclosure, but at a moderate level of energy. Eventually he runs in the wheel, but his favorite activity (other than napping) is to chew apple sticks!\n\n\\-Delilah Agatha (aka. Dee, Dee-dee, Dee-dee the dasher) (3rd picture): She is a whole different story, she loves humans paying attention to her and she loves pets and play time. She loves cleaning time, and she will try to take everything you're using around her cage. She jumps from one level to the other in a second and you're not paying attention; she will try to make a run through the door.\n\nThey are located in Sacramento, CA and I work in Davis, CA. Again, this is really a hard decision to take but we want to give them the chance to find the best home possible and avoid jeopardizing their wellbeing. Let me know if you have any questions!"

The club idea is to gather in a park or public place, and we will take turns holding still/modeling for \\~five minute and draw each other, so that we can all practice portrait/figure drawing from life! No skill level required. The focus of the group is to provide an opportunity to practice drawing humans without paying for an actual figure drawing class ;) so the primary rule of participating is you do have to take your turn posing for at least a few minutes, but your pose is up to you and can be simple as sitting in your chair. Everyone should feel comfortable; that is the second rule of the club, to keep a chill vibe and respect boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to draw but you'd like to come help and model for us and have some art made of yourself, please come too! You can read a book, meditate, do your own craft, or just plain hang out.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you at all, please comment/message me! I will rope you in the next time I manage to gather my tiny group of drawing friends, or we can plan our own date if there are enough of us.\n\nI KNOW some of you are artistic anime/manga nerds and if you want to practice drawing people so you can perfect your fanart skills, this is perfect for you!

We both love Meshuggah, Power Trip, The Police, Soundgarden, Death Grips, among others.\n\nWe’re mainly looking for a vocalist. Someone who isn’t afraid to scream, sing, rap, screech, talk in free time, or lock in with odd meters. Whatever it takes to elevate the music. The main goal is to play shows and eventually get stuff out on streaming.\n\nHere’s a short demo we recorded:\n https://youtu.be/AfFG2HI0TvI?si=cJiXWW7UIq_28vuJ\n\nWe’re also looking for a bassist, but finding the right vocalist is the main priority.\n\nALSO! \n\nIf anyone knows of any UC Davis-related Instagram accounts or pages where local musicians or artists post (something like @ucdavismusicians or @ucdavisbands), please drop them here! I couldn’t find any but figure there must be some music-related student or art pages floating around.\n\nIf you’re interested or know someone who might be, DM me or comment your Instagram."

All of the friends I made are more introverted or get tired easily and like to spend lots of time on their own in their dorms. Meanwhile I’m more of an extrovert, and I really hate sitting/studying alone. I keep on seeing friend groups walking around at night and talking or studying and I’m kinda jealous 😭\n\nSo I just wanted to see if anyone was feeling similarly and would want to spend time together! (Or introduce me to their friends/make a little group 👀) orrr if anyone just had advice. Sorry for the long post I just dk what else to do as I’ve been talking to so many new people wherever I can 😭"

However, I looked back and realized neither was the case, and at that point it was too late for me 💔\n\nI’m missing classes that count participation points. But luckily they all give at least two excused absences. What I don’t get is why students choose to go to class sick instead of taking advantage of the excused absences. The classes I’m in don’t even have midterms for another two weeks and lectures are recorded, so really there’s no reason for you to be in class. \n\nIn short: Please wear a mask or better yet, don’t come to class if you’re sick. Leave the room if you’re having a coughing fit. \n\nAnyways, that’s my rant. \n\nMay none of you catch a cold. Stay healthy everyone. "

However, after years of slimming down and streamlining, you should be able to knock this survey out in less than 10 minutes.\n\n**If you received an email inviting you to take the survey, please complete the survey**. And if the pleading of a bunch of transportation nerds isn't enough, do consider that you can opt in for a chance to win one of 80 $50 CoHo gift cards at the end of the survey.\n\n\\-- Transportation Demand Manager\n\nPS - Want to see the results of all of the previous surveys?

        "body": "Yesterday at the library around 5:30pm I was sitting at those secluded desk with the little shelfs in front on the 3rd floor doing my biology lab. And I see this dude walking towards my direction where I was sitting I didn't think much of it because it's normal for people to walk here and there in the library. However, I see that he starts to tie his shoe and eventually he sits on the floor in front of my desk in between me and this other girl while the other desks were completely empty. I didn't think much of it since I was trying to do my biology lab. Eventually I look down and I see that his hand is extremely close to my foot, I was wearing sandals (luckily with socks on) I didn't think much of it since people do lean on their hands when they sit on the ground. However he kept doing this and getting to close to my foot at which point he gets so close that I'm literally stepping on his fingers with my sandal even after that he still doesn't remove his hand under my sandal until I move my feet away. I also noticed that he was using the reflection of his phone to look at my crotch area. He was tilting his phone in a way where he could see my crotch area. I eventually get up and confront him saying if he needs anything and he says no. His excuse was that he had a condition where his knees lock and it's painful for him so he has to sit on the ground but that didn't even make sense since he didn't leave until I told him too. If he was feeling better why didn't he leave earlier. After he does leave, I go down to the first floor at the main desk and tell them what happened. Eventually the police gets involved and I tell the police officer what happened and currently right now they are in process of writing a report about this fucking weirdo. Also the girl that was at the desk in front of me also told me how this guy had done this to her, she even took pictures of him once again on the ground. I don't know if I'm allowed to post his face here but I can describe him as a white Caucasian male with short hair about 5\"7 in height. He was wearing a grey shirt with khaki pants yesterday. I'll post a picture of the area where it happened. "

        "body": "The Ags ring in Homecoming and Brewfest by taking on the pesky Northern Arizona Lumberjacks today! A win will put either team firmly in the driver's seat for an FCS Playoff bid and the Big Sky conference race, while a loss here would cause some serious regrouping in order to still have a chance of getting to the \"safe zone\" of 8 wins.\n\n.\n\n  \n**Game Overview**\n\nNAU has had a somewhat similar path to Davis this season, with wins over two of the same opponents. However, unlike the Ags, NAU has had something approaching a respectable win so far in Incarnate Word, and came away with a not-terrible score when losing to a very good Arizona State team. UCD meanwhile is still hunting for a genuine quality win, and we could arguably get one this afternoon.\n\nThe big story ont he personnel side is that the conference's best defensive player, Rex Connors, is out for the season for Davis, and potentially his brother Porter as well. However, defensive additions like Jacob Psyk have stepped up in a big way in terms of putting pressure and forcing turnovers. The Ags likely won't be able to stop NAU outright, but have a good chance of slowing them down, keeping them off-kilter, and keeping the score manageable. On the offensive side of the ball, the Ags will want to establish a ground game to control possession and clock, which should be doable since RB duo Jordan Fisher and Carter Vargas have been incredible this year and backstopped by QB Caden Pinnick's running ability.\n\n.\n\n**Game Promos**\n\nToday also marks Brewfest, with an option to add entry to pre-game festivities as part of your ticket. **For non-students** \\-- on the normal [single-game ticket purchase page](https://ucdavisaggies.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=GS:UCD:FB2526:FB1011:&amp;linkID=twucd&amp;dataAccId=779&amp;locale=en_US&amp;siteId=ev_twucd), you can select Purchase by Price to add a brewfest combo for your ticket. **For students** \\-- I understand from [this thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1o3j90c/brewfest/)that you can purchase your Brewfest add-on at [ucdavisaggies.com/studenttix](http://ucdavisaggies.com/studenttix) for $40, which inscludes beer samplers.\n\nToday also marks the limited [return of Tube Sock Madness](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPpVM1njTIt/), which was a touchdown and fourth-quarter tradition in the 2000s and 2010s. These things were worth their weight in gold when I was there, and I'm only slightly exaggerating. Make sure to arrive early to get good seats in the student section to catch the flying tube socks!\n\n.\n\n**Stream:** [Watch ESPN](https://www.espn.com/watch/) (needs ESPN Select or better subscription)\n\n**Student Tickets:** [ucdavisaggies.com/studenttix](http://ucdavisaggies.com/studenttix)\n\n"

I’m leaning towards doing bis this year (alongside calc, gen chem, and an independent research study in RST that I’m starting now) but I wanted to hear input from ppl who have already taken the courses :) any input or considerations?? \nThanks!! \n\nI’ll also be meeting with an academic advisor again to confirm which is the best calc and orgo series to take, but if anyone has input on that lmk 😅 but yeah how do I not fry my gpa 🥲"

I'm hoping I can be readmitted into the psychology major - I'm currently in the college of engineering. \n\n  \nI'm curious if anyone can shed some light for me if they've been in a similar situation. I have completed a lot of credits already because I withdrew beginning of my senior year. I have around 145 credits. I'm hoping I can still change my major to psych even after completing this amount of credits. Does anyone have any idea of what an advisor would say about my situation? \n\nI'm actively trying to set up an advising appointment with the psychology department. Currently have an appointment with the engineering college! \n\n  \nThank you so much! Hope to be back soon :) "
