My dream would be to do my undergrad for Veterinary school here and join the Cal Band, both things I'm extremely passionate about. I've maintained a GPA of 4.22, currently taking 3 AP classes and taking another 3 next year. Unfortunately, I find myself with 2 B's right now but I'm hoping to at least bring one up before the end of the semester! While I have this heavy passion and ambition to get it, I'm very worried about the extracurricular part of the application process. I'm not very involved with my school, I'm chronically ill and have chronic fatigue it's hard for me to even get through school days a lot of the time. I'm in marching band and jazz band as section leader/ overall band assistant and volunteer at least 1 hour every week to my local animal shelter, I'm also am in CSF but that's about as extensive as my list gets. I will say I do have excellent English skills and am extremely good at essays. I plan on writing mine about my chronic illness and my experience in physical therapy for chronic pain where doctors constantly praised me for being so strong when to me this was just life. I want to talk about how I've never let my pain or fatigue stop me from dreaming or achieving, when I've realized so many others in my position would give up. Berkeley is my dream and I want to do all I can to get in. What do we think? Will they take into consideration my chronic illness since I am disclosing it and maybe be more lenient on my extracurriculars?\n\nEdit: just remembered I also am planning on taking AP Spanish next year as one of my AP classes and hopefully become bilingual \"certified\" by my school, another unique thing to add to my application!"

It's difficult to predict what will happen in 2027, but I wonder whether California currently is safe/welcoming to Chinese students and whether violence/crime is a prominent issue?\n\n- Apparently I'll have to search for my own living space. I wonder if finding living space in that area might be difficult, and if it might be very expensive?\n\n- If anyone who is studying / studied undergrad physics in UCB might be reading this, I wonder if the physics courses there might be very hard or have very high workload? \n\nWould also appreciate if there's any other info that might be useful to know!"

But when looking at the eecs guidelines, I'm seeing that I can only waitlist(?) the major?\n\nAlso - I chose DS because in DS internships in high school I got to work on pipelines, develop ML models and classifiers, used deep unsupervised learning, develop full stack AI apps, etc. And the cs and swe majors focused on systems engineering, embedded programming which I wasn't interested in. But I'm worried that DS at Berkeley is mostly focused on wrangling, analytics, and basic ML rather than advanced ML, deep learning, and agentic ai. I'm not sure if I would be significantly restricted in my course options later on and wanted some guidance on if I should switch. Also interested in comp bio so the domain emphasis aspect looked really cool "

You can pop into the HRS Hop Shop to pick out a small treat or toy for them as a Halloween goodie too, or simply purchase something special for your rabbit at home!\n\nAdmission is free, though donations of any size are welcome to support the rabbits in our care and our life-saving medical and educational programs."

I am a transgender man and while I was filling out my housing application, I submitted an identity accommodation because I present myself extremely femininely and I would not feel comfortable living with a cisgender man because they are amab and I am afab. Additionally, 2 days ago I received an email saying they do not do identity accommodations for Clark Kerr because they have limited space and I am unsure what I should do. I also believe my roommate will be a cisgender man because I stated I was a transgender man on my UC application and identified as male so on my housing application it stated I was male so it wouldn‚Äôt misgender me. That being said all the roommates it recommended me were cisgender males and if I chose to live on a same sex floor it would be all cisgender males. I plan on calling them today but I‚Äôm not sure if there is anything else I can do. I am looking for advice and if there is a way for me to become roommates with a woman. "

Before Lorde even came on stage, two people in the pit had already fainted. Then during the show, it had to be stopped twice because more people passed out. Even after that, staff had to keep going into the crowd throughout the night. I counted at least 5 or 6 incidents. It was honestly wild!\n\nIf you‚Äôre planning to camp out, please take care of yourselves. Bring food and water, drink electrolytes, and pack cooling items like mini fans. They‚Äôre super cheap and make a big difference. I get that some things are out of our control, but staying hydrated and prepared is important, especially when you're standing for hours in tightly packed crowds where it gets hot fast. It sucks that people didn‚Äôt fully get to experience the concert because they had to see the medical team because they were having medical emergencies. \n\nAs someone who goes to concerts pretty regularly, I‚Äôve truly never seen anything like what happened last night. Take care of yourselves out there\n "

My crowd estimate was at least 500 people, probably more, at peak. But less than 1,000. \n\nThere were multiple other Berkeley protests, so people were spread out through the city, not all rallying at one site. This rally had a nice mix of ages, including many who (by age at least) were likely to have been Cal students. "

        "body": "Let me start by saying that I am qualified to speak on this issue because this is my second time at Cal after finishing undergrad in 2016 (I‚Äôm getting my MA currently). The RSF has made virtually zero improvements to any part of the space in almost ten years, and I‚Äôm completely over it. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. \n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the size. I‚Äôm no expert on university gyms, but for the size of Berkeley, this gym feels comically small - hence, why it‚Äôs packed at all hours. Someone mentioned in another post that while the student body grows every year, the RSF stays the same. There are the ten or so smaller rooms on the cardio floor (which could be consolidated and made into a larger functional space) but at least half of them are completely empty and unused at all times. It makes absolutely no sense. \n\nNext, the machines. Oh my god. Not only are most of them old, but at any given time in the weight room, expect 10% of the machines to be broken or defective in some way (this applies to the cardio machines, too). \n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about cleanliness. The place STINKS. There are minimal fans running and zero AC. The weight room gets extremely stuffy and smells like a$$, and the mirrors on the wall are consistently dirty and grimy. I get the sense that the place hasn‚Äôt been properly sanitized in years. Half of the wet wipe stations are always empty. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if this is a public university issue or something entirely different, but I‚Äôm astounded at how awful RSF is these days. I visited my sister once at Cal Poly and the gym was an absolute dream. \n\nI love Berkeley, I really do (why else would I be here for a second time), but the RSF is an absolute embarrassment. The money to improve the facility exists, it‚Äôs just clearly not a priority. \n"

I go to career fairs, attend workshops, talk to recruiters, and add them on LinkedIn but then nothing really happens afterward. I always feel weird about asking for a ‚Äúcoffee chat,‚Äù. The problem is, whenever I focus on career stuff, I can‚Äôt focus on my classes and social life. But when I focus on school or friends, I don‚Äôt have time to focus on preparing my careers. It‚Äôs like I am behind, no matter what I choose to prioritize. Has anyone else felt this way? How do you actually balance things out, between studying, networking, applying, and socializing?

If I‚Äôm just responding to you I‚Äôm sorry - I immediately went to take a midterm üò≠]\n\nHey Berkeley,\n\nI'm reaching out because I'm honestly heartbroken and need your help.\n\nI lost my mother's watch somewhere around Berkeley on Thursday, October 9th. The clasp was loose and it just fell off without me noticing - I didn't realize until the next day when I went to check the time.\n\nThis watch isn't just a watch to me. My mom wore this every single day for over 20 years. Seeing it on my wrist reminds me of her and keeps me connected to her. Losing it feels like I've lost a piece of her.\n\n**What it looks like:**\n\n* Brand: Citizen Quartz (says \"CITIZEN QUARTZ\" on the face)\n* Style: Dainty women's dress watch with a rectangular/elongated face\n* Band: Gold-tone metal bracelet with a delicate link pattern\n* Face: White/cream textured dial with gold hands and simple hour markers\n* Size: Small/petite women's watch, very lightweight\n* The watch has a classic, elegant vintage look\n\n**Where I was that day:**¬†Downtown Berkeley\n\nI know Berkeley is a big place and this is probably a needle in a haystack, but this community has always come through for people. I've seen you all reunite people with lost pets, wallets, and even keys.\n\nIf you were walking around Ace Apartments on October 9th and saw a watch on the ground, or if you work at a business in the area and someone turned one in - please, please DM me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awxxot1zljvf1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c42e4e92decf8f5ea7a8a31134834d5948621ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s325pd80mjvf1.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f31192de672d18088b001f5a2884af76b0ed89a1\n\n**I'm offering a reward, no questions asked.**¬†I just want it back.\n\nThank you for reading this.

My roommates and I went in for a tour, and the \"tour\" was just the staff showing us some generated pictures of what the apartment could look like on a tablet, and walking us through some model designs of beds, kitchen counters, fridges, etc that were in the office. I am a little bit skeptical because we haven't seen the building in real life, we don't know how big one room is, and they're also SO SO desperate to get us to sign (they offered us a $250 visa gift card if we signed a lease within the next 72 hours, which I feel like would not be the smartest idea). For the floor plans that they have available, it's $999 per month per person to share a triple. I think it‚Äôs a little expensive but maybe not entirely undoable. But I do feel like it would be kinda silly to sign a lease for a house we haven‚Äôt even seen. Has anyone else gone on tours as well? What do you guys think? Am I being overly skeptical?"

For reference, I have multiple interests that keep leading me back to 1970-1990's Berkeley as the epicenter of it all. Think the natural foods movement, farm to table dining, meditation and mindfulness, vegetarianism, ecoconciousness, and chez panisse. I assume the tech industry is likely large now in the area, due to the proximity of Silicon Valley, but what else is different (or not)?\n\nNot looking to move to Berkeley (California's COL scares me), but thinking of visiting one day. \n\nThanks!"

I know the majority of transfers here are from CC, so it makes sense that there isn't a lot of information for transfer credit counting towards degree class reqs for UC or other 4 year institution transfers. But currently, I was told by an Education advisor that the education courses that I took at UCR probably wouldn't count towards my major reqs here. I'm just a bit confused as to why they can't count, or if anyone else has encountered something similar? I'm double majoring, which already means I have a bit more course load to juggle, but now I've been told that it's possible I'll have to start my education degree from scratch. Has anyone else been through a similar issue, and if so, what did you do to fix it? \n\n  \nI'm also just frustrated with this entire thing because I spent the majority of my 2 years at UCR trying to finish my general eds. 1: because I was told it's probably best to do so if I wanted to transfer (though that may be outdated info at this point), and 2: UCR seems to emphasize a lot more on general eds than Berkeley, because we had to complete about 17 courses for our general eds whereas here we only need to do 7. So now I'm stuck with all these general eds that I don't even know can count towards my graduation reqs, and a bunch of incomplete major classes that counted at UCR but don't count here. \n\n  \nDoes anyone know what I can do to fix this situation? I've already submitted some of the syllabi of my education courses back at Riverside to my advisory, hoping they can count them towards my major at this point. "

Either way, I told him weeks in advance that I had a midterm that week and that I would NEED to spend that weekend studying. I explained that this class has 2 exams that makeup the grade and nothing else, so this was obviously really important. My typical midterm study schedule, the one I‚Äôve used for my midterms the past two weeks have been: rest day Friday, 6 hrs sat, 6 hrs sun, 6 hrs Monday (AT LEAST). ^(don‚Äôt have class M, F). I try my best to develop a job-like routine because I‚Äôm taking 21 units (16 Berkeley, 5 CC). Now, I‚Äôm a double major in economics and legal studies (working towards CPA hence CC), and he is a business of film major. I do understand that we don‚Äôt do the same things exactly so like I can‚Äôt expect him to understand what it is EXACTLY that I do. BUT I feel like this weekend I studied maybe 6ish hours  (Non-Consecutive) and he \nwanted to leave for half of them. Like he was so appalled at the idea of staying at the library all day - something he claims he has never done. (Even though I said that‚Äôs what I needed to do). I really do always bag on him about how USC is a joke and how like we have so many Nobel Prizes, the academic rigor, etc.  I‚Äôve always felt that we functioned in two different worlds academically because BERKELEY IS FUCKING HARD AND YOU NEED TO STUDY HARD AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL. Guess a part of me just wonders if it is the difference in our majors or the difference in our schools. \n\nTLDR: Is Berkeley infinitely more rigorous than USC or do some majors just not push people very hard?

Do you check Reddit for stuff like that, or mostly see it through friends / orgs / Insta stories?\n\nIf you‚Äôre a current student (or recent alum), we‚Äôd love to hear what channels you actually notice or trust on campus. üôè\n\nThanks in advance ‚Äî and if anyone‚Äôs curious about the challenge idea, happy to share more once we figure out the right channels to post it."

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sign up for major discounts to use Ninja Warrior training facilities with your friends with several coaches at your fingertips!\n\n  \nImportant information:\n\n\\- There are courses and training opportunities for ALL skill levels and levels of commitment. Interested in competing? We got you. Just want to goof off with some friends in a more exciting playground? We're there. Want to humble some egos, maybe even your own? Go for it! Need to get some zoomies out in a new, extremely discounted, and awesome environment? Sign up!\n\n\\- The gym gets updated pretty frequently which different courses/obstacles being altered or replaced in some way, so it will probably be a little different every time that you come :) You can also make your own course that staff can time you in (to compete with friends or just to see how fast you are), or the staff can make one for you!\n\n\\- We do NOT have a schedule set up yet, and are making it based on YOUR schedule, so please use the link in the general-info channel to let us know when you are available!\n\n\\- Officers have not been chosen yet, so if you are even a little interested, let us know! \n\n\\- We \\*WILL\\* be getting epic discounts on the gym, less than $15 but actual numbers are still up in the air.\n\n\\- If you really like the gym, you can get more private lessons! While they are not advertised as one-on-one, they are extremely intimate because this gym is not super popular, so you might get a one-on-one class\n\n\\- Because this gym is not extremely popular (it's just a pretty niche thing, there is nothing wrong with the gym at ALL. A handful of clubs at Cal went to check it out last Friday and it was INCREDIBLE), it is usually pretty empty too!\n\n\\- The gym is in Richmond, so there is a commute necessary, but it is not very long. Here is the gym if you want to check it out: [Home | Traverse Fitness](https://www.traversefit.com/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umib7zjxbkuf1.jpg?width=1360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9d409f1b3185314a1c51508ce12f0db504ba59\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z94dpaz6ckuf1.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f8b59b23d967d3038f01baaee998acae530faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hj7satedckuf1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e09c688b82e440fc28d21eb53e831ae668e603\n\n"

        "body": "Let me preface this by saying that this is not a rigorous study, but an anecdote from an experienced tech worker at an SV start up that is growing rapidly and primarily employs software engineers. I did not attend Berkeley but always admired and generally get along with my coworkers who did. I've been a guest at your campus many times.\n\nMy company has been in hiring mode for the past few months and conducts multiple interviews every day. As with many VC-backed start ups, we prioritize interviewing engineers from big tech companies and graduates from top schools, which includes Berkeley. \n\nIt should surprise no one that unauthorized AI and LLM usage is a growing problem in many areas, including hiring. It's especially problematic because it's often not possible to say that someone's answer definitively was not their own, even if it's strongly suspected during early interview rounds. That's all to say that there is a degree of uncertainty until a candidate comes on site and can be tested in a controlled environment.\n\nI lead a team adjacent to the engineering org and speak with their hiring managers and interviewers frequently about process and hiring status. Lately, nearly every interviewer I've spoken to has said the same thing: cheating is rampant, and Berkeley grads are the worst offenders.\n\nI'm posting this here because I still have a lot of respect for your unviersity and hope that this trend can be turned around. Cheating doesn't only affect the person doing it, but reflects badly on your school and can impact your classmates'/alumni job prospects as well. We probably won't consider new grads from Berkeley for a while, at least in engineering, as a result. And that is a shame."
