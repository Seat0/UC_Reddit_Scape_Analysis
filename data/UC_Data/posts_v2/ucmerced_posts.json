This is a theoretical scenario, where Merced actually was planning out a streetcar/light rail line, I have an idea provided by the image, where it connects the airport with Downtown/Transpo, Olive Ave., Merced College, Bellevue Ranch, and UC Merced all along M St. (which imo has HUGE potential for a line). What are some of your ideas for a streetcar/light rail line in Merced? If you don't think Merced should have streetcar/light rail, what are your ideas/opinions to make THE BUS better to use?"

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m transferring for Spring 2026, and I’m torn between Software Engineering (SE) at SJSU and CSE at UC Merced. Both have strong appeal for different reasons, and I could really use some insight from current students (especially UCM CSE majors) before I make my final decision. \n\n**Here is how I see It and some questions I have about the CSE program:**\n\nIf I go to UCM, I’d be commuting from home (about 45–60 minutes), and although I would also be commuting/carpooling to SJSU, the much shorter commute to UCM would save me a lot of time and energy to dedicate to school and everything else. \n\nThat said, something I’ve noticed when looking through UCM’s upper-division CSE courses is that a lot of them are intro classes or theory-focused, rather than applied or project-heavy. I know that’s  the nature of the researched based UC system, but it makes me wonder how much actual hands-on experience you walk away with.\n\n**CSE Career Questions:**\n\n1. How competitive or effective are the internships available to CSE students? Are most local, remote, or more research-based?\n2. How is networking and the alumni connection here? do professors, clubs, or past students help with internships or job leads?\n3. How is the capstone/senior project structured? Does it give you real hands-on, team-based experience like what you’d get in industry?\n4. How well do you feel the CSE program actually prepares you for the industry? Do you leave feeling confident in your technical skills (software design, teamwork, version control, etc.), or is it more academic/theoretical?\n\n**CSE Campus/Academic Questions:**\n\n1. How realistic is it to find on-campus IT or SE-related jobs (like help desk, systems support, or web dev)? I have a year of experience working for my CC's IT Help Desk and would love to find a campus job at UCM. \n2.  Has registration started already for Spring 2026?\n3. Are most upper-div classes only offered in person, or are there online/hybrid options available?\n4. Has Spring 2026 registration started yet, and are there any classes that tend to disappear quickly?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI’m deciding between SJSU’s Software Engineering and UCM’s Computer Science &amp; Engineering programs for Spring 2026. I’d really appreciate honest input from current or past UCM CSE students, especially about how well the program prepares you for the industry, internship and networking opportunities, and overall campus experience.\n\n**Note:**  \nIf anyone would be open to answering some of these questions more in-depth, I’d really appreciate doing a quick call or Zoom chat sometime. As you can tell I’ve got a lot of questions and would love to hear directly from someone who’s been through it. Feel free to DM me if you’re up for it! Thank you🙏"

Courses and sections will be added for each new semester as the course schedule releases from UC Merced.\n\nI am hoping that a central space makes it easier to find classmates, share notes and relevant materials, stay connected, and ask questions in a group forum.

        "body": "For reference I’m a gay guy originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and also a 2nd year. Unless you want to experience both hatred and isolation due to your sexuality I’d suggest you go somewhere else. While the university itself including the staff are very accepting for the most part, and the university purposefully tries to come across as being for the students, it’s the student body that makes everything else insignificant. Majority of the men on this campus either are homophobic, or aren’t homophobic but still aren’t the most accepting. You’ll find a few good ones, but it feels as though everyone is always negative, they’re just tolerating your sexuality because they have to. As a gay guy it’s hard to find real friendships with other guys, causing you to resort to being in friend groups with only other women. You try and be nice to a guy trying to become his friend, but everyone here is so childish that they automatically assume that you’re hitting on them. And on anonymous apps like Fizz, students actually spread rampant homophobia constantly. I’ve actually experienced hateful comments and other harassment in person due to students at this university, based solely on the fact that I don’t hide my sexuality. On top of this hatred, being that you’re in such a small environment away from the actual town of Merced, it creates a sense of alienation with nothing you could really do about it, especially without a car. The gay male community here seems so small, which causes the actual gay men here to come across rude and arrogant as a defense mechanism. Especially when it comes to looking conventionally attractive or not. The culture here is that if a gay guy seems conventionally attractive (ie works out, is handsome, etc) the straight men seem to tolerate him more. Giving them a superiority complex, and pitting different gay guys against eachother. And god forbid a gay guy here portrays his femininity. And this is just in relation to platonic relationships. Gay men at this university, at least from what I’ve seen as a student, don’t really find love or romance. Sure there are a few that get lucky, but if you want any romantic connection you need to resort to gay hookup apps like Grindr or Sniffies. And the culture on those is even worse in the town of Mercedes. Students are explicit with their hatred, causing gay guys who want to experience stuff like that to resort to risky sexual encounters with much older men on those apps. The system itself is extremely negative, and it seems as though it’s going to continue at least for the foreseeable future. If you’re a gay high school senior applying to colleges, coming from another gay guy who’s stuck here due to his mental health depleting and his grades dropping, please just pick any other UC or CSU.

UC Merced has the highest amount of undergrads involved in research within the UC system. Also, I believe the smaller class sizes compared to larger UCs also allow for a better learning environment because of easier access to professors.\n\nAfter college, I want to pursue a PHD in some field of Physics. I think UC Merced is a great choice for me to apply to because of its smaller learning environment, easier access to professors, and opportunities to do research, which are heavily important for pursuing a PHD.\n\nAre my assumptions correct? Is there any advice you can offer? How is the Physics Department at UC Merced? How easy is it really to get involved in research? At what year do students usually get access to research opportunities? Are there any other opportunities Physics majors have access to at UC Merced other than faculty-guided research?\n\nAdditionally, I am coming down for a tour of UC Merced’s Natural Sciences Department in a few weeks. I would be grateful if anyone could give me any helpful information about that too. Thanks!"

Also, if we name it The Joy Luck Club (after the amy tan book) it gives us a reason to make food during meetings. (like we could do communal dumpling wrapping or sticky rice wrapping). The obvious problem with that is food safety but I am a clean freak and I can potentially get a food handlers certificate if we really need it. Honestly, this is kind of two club ideas in one but I think the mix of food and mahjong would be amazing. (I know there already is a Chinese culture club, but i want a club thats mahjong focused) \n\nWould anyone be interested in this? What do y'all think? I want to do it."

Not bad.\n   * He also began hiring some tutors (not sure who) starting this week bc the quiz scores from the past were becoming poor\n      * His tutors are meant to help students who receive bad scores on their quizzes and improve their grade\n\n\n\n* SteamPlug is owned by him\n\nEdit 21/10/25: Some of these rumors are true, but he's not a bad professor in person after weeks of having him. Trust me. See my long comment for the explanation.

I am a high school senior who will be graduating in May 2026.\n\nI am from Sacramento, and I do not have a good opinion of the general Merced area, as it is relatively lacking development and has a higher crime rate, although I know anywhere can be dangerous if you aren’t practicing basic safety precautions.\n\nI have a 3.6 unweighted GPA and a 4.2 weighted gpa. I am in the top 12% of my class (not 10% sadly, as I heard that makes admissions in some way easier). I am currently in the process of filling out my UC PIQs, and I want to know more about UC Merced.\n\nIf I were to be accepted, I would hopefully be majoring in the Neuroscience, B.S. Pre-Medical Emphasis program for premed. After graduation and the MCAT, I would want to attend medical school.\n\nAlthough I am aware that I haven’t  even applied or been accepted to any schools yet, I am considering UC Merced over other UCs because of its smaller student body and perceived abundance of opportunities. I am aware that UC Merced does not have as high of a premed/medical reputation as schools like UC Davis, but I feel like UC Merced’s smaller class sizes would fit me better and give me more of a community experience.\n\nI will get quicker to the point with a list of questions:\n\n- UC Merced has the greatest amount of undergrads in research within the UC system due to its smaller student body. Are there also good research opportunities for premed?\n\n- Is admission into UC Merced reasonable with my stats? 3.6 unweighted GPA and 4.2 weighted GPA. Top 12%. I believe my UC GPA is 3.87.\n\n- Are there good extracurricular opportunities for premed, such as shadowing and volunteering at a local hospital or practice? In particular, I am interested in Family Medicine.  I am not familiar with the Merced area.\n\n- How is UC Merced as an Asian? I am concerned about how I would fit in, as there is a significant difference in Asian presence in Merced compared to Sacramento.\n\n- How is the campus and school environment? Is it a good learning environment? How much pressure and competition is present? How beautiful is the campus?\n\n- How is the town of Merced now? What kind of experience does it offer? I need hotpot to survive. Is the crime as bad as some people say?\n\n- Is UCM a commuter campus? I’d preferably want a larger on-campus experience and have more social exposure. Of course, I would proactively engage with others and join clubs too."

I think I am ready for a PhD and willing to invest in research as I love it, but I am overthinking whether I am truly competitive to do so. I have been in the same lab for two years studying genomics and plant ecology, another fieldwork/data analysis-based government-funded research experience, have an NIH fellowship and a big industry biotech-funded scholarship, which came with molecular lab workshops/experience, sadly no publication, and only two conference presentations. I am also concerned about my letters of rec, as I have two strong ones but am falling short on my third one.\n\nI guess just trying to gauge everyone else's experience applying and what made them competitive enough to receive an offer, and if maybe I should just pursue an MS for now...

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nSo I just wanted to quickly rant about how fucking awful this campus has been run since the day I got here 6 years ago. Seems like it’s topical given the recent parking problems, and since this has been bouncing around in my mind for a while I wanted to get it off my chest. Before I really get into it I wanted to be very clear and say that I actually love UCM. I did my undergrad here, I continued to grad school here, and this city and campus have become a part of my life. My main gripe is with campus administration, and I think you’ll agree after reading this that they are the main obstacle to having a university we can be truly proud of. \n\nLet’s start with housing. When I first came here in 2019, there was a of directly associated off-campus housing with contractual obligations to the UC. Additionally there were the existing dormitories that are on campus today, some of which were under construction at the time. The dorms on academic walk were famously constructed by contractors who had rub shoulders and I must assume greased the wheels of campus admin, rather than winning their supposedly “competitive bid” honestly. It’s these same contractors that chalk up the lack of drop ceiling and exposed utilities to post-modern design and “ease of maintenance.” This decision is what allowed a student in the very first year of Glacier Point’s opening to hang from a water pipe on the 6th floor, causing to to break and rupture, thereby flooding the entire building. Say what you want about the kid, what kind of idiotic design doesn’t account for the fact that college students do stupid shit and maybe utilities shouldn’t be exposed???? The kind of design that doesn’t require any thinking and has the soul goal to extract as much money out of public funds as possible.\n\nSecond, let’s address food. Some of you may know about the absolute debacle that was the pavilion dining center immediately after COVID. For those of you who don’t, it was truly a horrific sight to see. Some famous highlights: bugs in the vegetables, Chernobyl burger patties, undercooked chicken, and skyrocketing cases of food-borne illness. I won’t spend too long on this because it’s been covered extensively, but there were two central issues with how the pavilion was operating. One, some of the absolute cheapest possible ingredients were being sourced from Sysco, resulting in really low quality to start with, and student workers at the pav were zoinked out of their minds. Literally hearing directly from employees that students would clock into their shift high, drunk, and even crossed, resulting in frequent mistakes in food preparation. Now you might ask, why? Ok sure, we all hate our jobs, but why are people making these decisions, coming into work so blasted that they can pretend it’s not their reality? Because the working conditions at the time were fucking awful, because they were criminally understaffed and underpaid, and because the pav admin didn’t care. See, something you need to understand to make sense of all these decisions is: the dining centers are not actually owned and operated by the university. Or rather, they are, but these entities exist as “private companies” within the UC system as a whole. These companies are in a funny situation. You see, they are expected to make a profit, but their income is mostly fixed. Given that most people who eat at the pavilion are on campus residents who pre-purchased a meal plan, the pav as a company doesn’t actually have to try to compete for your money. Given that the two DCs are the only fixed dining options on campus, and on campus residents have to pay extra to eat from the fairly inconsistent food trucks, they don’t even really HAVE any competition. Consider that on weekends, students literally only can eat at the DCs or pick up microwavable food from the student store, and I think you’ll understand my point. The DCs aren’t beholden to anyone, especially not their customers or employees. Students are forced to eat subpar food (which I will admit has gotten a little better over the years but is NOTHING compared to the food at other UCs) and workers are forced to work with scolding water without protection, their hours are not respected for class times, and they are underpaid leading to understaffing and overworking. This is remarkably different from how they operate UCLA’s dining hall, widely regarded as the best public university dining hall in the country. Now, why would a campus necessity, something that other campuses have proven can be better operated as part of their Housing, be operated as a private entity? Well that simple. To “save money”, UCM’s Project 2020 (which constructed the pav and all the dorms on academic walk) was operated as a public-private partnership. Using public funds to get private companies to build projects for the UC with a catch: the pavilion is, to this day, paying off its construction as well as accruing contractually mandated profits for Plenary Properties Merced, a shell of Plenary, a company the specializes in the business of public private partnership. Meaning they have no attachment to this campus, no obligation to run a real business, no interest in reinvesting all the money they have extracted out of this community back into it. \n\nFinally, TAPS. Ooohhhhh TAPS, I don’t think I’ve ever hated an entity as much as you. TAPS is actually the first element of campus administration to ever have been privatized, with its inception back in 2005 along with the beginnings of campus. Turns out, TAPS actually owns all the parking lots as their “own land” and to build the current work on housing and the potential future work on the student union, the university will have to “buy back” the land from ITSELF. Now that’s not really the most egregious thing. If anything, that’s just a matter of paperwork and shuffling money around. No, TAPS, although owned indirectly by the UC, is separately operated on a contractual basis by Laz parking. "

        "body": "Hey guys, I recently went to the job fair and saw this position available, however I can’t find any information about it online/on Handshake and have no idea whether it’s worth applying for. I had a class right after I took this picture and didn’t ask much in person for the sake of time. I waited too long to think of emailing them, and I’m not sure they’d reply even if I had emailed them as has been my experience with other jobs with little available info like these. \n\nAll I know is that they are looking for customer service experience, which I don’t have, and which makes me think this position is mostly an office position with little contact with the graduate part of the job title. \n\nFor some personal information, I plan to go to graduate school (for research) and maybe transfer out of Merced by junior year (personal reasons) and I’m looking for thing to either add to my resume/application or to give me connections to get things I can add to my resume. What does event support mean? Which events? I’m also concerned because it says “federal work study position” so does that mean they prioritize people with a work study grant (I don’t have this)? \n\nIf anyone has done this position before or has any info, it would be much appreciated.

I was mainly thinking of trying to get a job at the Pavilion or dining services since I’ve heard they’re the most common jobs for students. But when I checked, I didn’t see any dining service or library service jobs listed.\n\nDoes anyone know if the Pavilion is still hiring right now? And if so, what’s the best way to ask—should I just go up to a worker and ask them to direct me to their manager? Or is there a better way?\n\nThe only job I might qualify for that’s currently listed is the *Recycling/Composting Student Assistant (Student Asst 1)*. Has anyone worked that job before—did you like it? I know a job is a job, but I’d love to hear what the experience is like from someone who’s done it.\n\nLastly, if anyone knows of departments or offices on campus that are still hiring students, please let me know! I’d really appreciate any advice or recommendations."

I've commented on this situation before on other posts but this is my first time doing my own post. As we know it the Bellevue lot is a hellish nightmare almost all hours of the day. I had class at 10:30am and got to the lot at 9:30am. The lot was FULL to the brim with cars already circling around trying to find a space. I had to park all the way in the back but by the green pathway and my class is in COB1. I come back after the long day to this ticket. Where I stand now is that I am REFUSING to pay and appealing. I encourage any commuters who get tickets to APPEAL APPEAL APPEAL! The campus does not deserve any more cash, it is an unjust bill for us. The permit is already full price and expensive for the amount of parking they are providing. \n\nBefore the semester started I emailed TAPS about my worries with this construction at Bellevue and was ghosted, but now they want to present me a bill??? DRINK DOGWATER!"

Unlike high school, everything is laid out for you, no need to wait until the professor assigns the work.\n\n\n\nTo start planning the assignments, divide them into portions for each of the day you will do before the deadline. I recommend using a calendar system that can automatically schedule things that can adapt to your routine. I personally use [Reclaim.ai](http://Reclaim.ai) for this, but you can use whatever you like free or paid.

        "body": "DISCLAIMER: No, I am not a shill or an employee working there. I am a first gen second year student that currently lives there and I didn't come from the richest background, so bear with me. I know I've only lived here for a week now but I felt the urge getting this out.\n\nI've noticed around here that Merced Station (MS for convenience) hasn't had the most positive reception in this subreddit, mainly due to its over pricing. Yet, despite your guys' warnings, I decided to live there because I figured it would be more cheaper than living in the dorms again, not to mention my experience with the dorms on campus wasn't the greatest.\n\nAt first I was very skeptical for how high the rent rates were, especially for singles, so I opted to live in a 6 person shared unit, sharing a room with another person. But over my time living there, I noticed that there were many things that have come out of this place. I'll sum MS's pros and cons.\n\nThe Good: \n- MC's bus transportation is actually pretty good if you do not have a car to go to campus. They operate from 8-4:30 from Monday to Friday. On weekends, I recommend getting a decent bike to travel to campus.\n-You can control your AC at MS to any temperate you want. \n-There's a good amount of places to hang out at MS. The pool, the gym, your own room, BBQ pits, the clubhouse, entertainment center and even an indoor movie theater.\n-For bike owners, there is a bike rack in which you can store your bike. Not at lot of people in my building own a bike, so there's plenty of space.\n-Since many people are busy doing something else, places like the gym and the pool are not overpopulated.\n- The units themselves aren't bad. They have a kitchen, a living room and a washing machine and dryer near your room. The room itself are also bigger than the dorms. \n\nThe Bad: \n- The rent here... yeah I can understand why people are critical about MS. For a unit with only two people living in it with separate rooms, the rent is like $1300. Absolutely insanity. You also have to pay for the move in fee which can cost over $1000.\n- Hidden costs actually persist. For example you also have to keep in mind that you have to pay for utilities and an optional service that reports your payment history to credit bureaus. Fees and fees just hand up to themselves. \n- Service can be very unhelpful, especially online, though that's very typical for places like this.\n- You cannot request to move into a new unit if you get chanced with a bad roommate (to my knowledge, someone fact check me on this).\n- Biking to campus during the afternoon can be hellish. Like, man it's only for 15 minutes but Merced isn't the most car friendly town. At least the distance from MS to the UC isn't too far.\n- If you're living with 6 other people like me, and your arrived last, you're gonna have trouble finding space for your dining plates and food, unless you're willing to commute eat on campus.\n\nThe Ugly: \n- It can get a bit boring at times. If you're wanting to make new friends here, it will be a bit difficult as everyone is busy with their own lives. \n- The parking here is mid because it's usually limited to residents and is compact. But at least it's better than leaving your cars out in the hot sun with no shade at all!\n- Some gated doors are broken. Idk if this is a good thing or a bad thing as a robber may get inside, but at least you don't have to use your keys.\n- You must inspect your room and kitchen and living room and bathroom for any damages within 72 hours of moving in or else they won't fix it unless you pay them really high. Luckily, this did not happen to me [yet].\n\nMy experience so far: Unlike what most people are thinking, I actually think it's not that bad? Lemme explain myself first before your raise your pitchforks and torches. Like yeah, there's some practices that MS that may warrant some hate from people, but I'd say that if you're looking for a better life out from the dorms and some actual things to do (ignoring rent), then maybe MS is the place for you! To me so far, nothing has really broken down and there's plenty of amenities to do. The issue is that I wish MS was a bit more lively at times just for the vibe itself. \n\nFinal verdict: If do not have the money, then yeah I recommend avoiding this place. Otherwise, MS is what you make out of it. It offers a lot of things for you, and it is your choice to use them as you wish and see if your money is actually worth to stay here. It could be the next step into living on your own from what I theorize. I'll let your responses be the judge. Good night, Merced! "

Some of this might be completely as wrong Ive literally only been in Merced for 2 days, but it's better than Google that's for sure.\n\nBy the way, as far as I understand all busses are free as long as you have your cat card. \n\nFirst up: Literally everything on Google maps is wrong(as of August 22nd, 2025). If you look up \"bus stop\" it gives you 3 bus stops on campus, literally none of these are still in service lmao. The actual stop doesn't show up.\n\nThe stop you're looking for is \"UTC\". It's next to the southern parking lot. It's technically 2 stops right next to each other, UTC south and UTC north. This is where you'll usually get on.\n\nLines: https://taps.ucmerced.edu/transportation  this site has all the lines(alternatively look up cat track), on weekends only lines E and D are running. It's really dumb since all it gives you is a list of locations and not an actual map of where they are, so you just gotta figure it out(or ask a bus driver like I did) I can tell you that the G line takes you straight to the city center though.\n\nWhen getting on, scan your id near the entrance and you're good.\n\nAgain, this is by all means NOT a comprehensive guide, feel free to correct me about anything I got wrong."

A club needs at least four members (the officers) and an advisor. I still need to fill out the remaining three positions and I don't know how hard it is to get an advisor for a club since I don't know the faculty enough and I don't know any alumni 😅 If you're interested in joining or helping out, join the Discord!

I sometimes walk through Valley Terraces as a way to get to Summits Marketplace, Half Dome game room, the gym, or the YWDC. I was thinking of bringing a TV or an Ethernet cable into my dorm.

(The unholy trio I know 🥀) More games may be added if there is broad demand.\n\nI also intend to make this a registered organization, so that students across UC Merced striving for a competitive gaming experience in these games have a place to thrive. Currently, there is no active registered organization for any of these games.\n\nCurrently, I am doing outreach to look for a UC Merced staff member or graduate student willing to be an advisor for our club. If you are interested in being one or have an idea of someone who may be interested, please let me know.\n\nI encourage all incoming students who are interested in joining to join our Discord, and any interest in being a staff member or assistance with helping me set this up will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank You\n\n  \nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/7fQkAcpYz3](https://discord.gg/7fQkAcpYz3)  \nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/esports\\_at\\_ucm/](https://www.instagram.com/esports_at_ucm/)"

        "body": "Let me give some quick background. My kid didn’t choose UCM. They ranked top 9% in their HS class and was placed in the ELC program for students. That means if they were waitlisted at any UC applied to, they’d be placed at UCM for a guaranteed UC campus spot. In other words we felt we were playing with house money. Also note that they will be 3rd generation college student, so they aren’t new to being around higher educated individuals. My spouse is also a full professor at another university.\n\nHowever, after our visit this week, it’s not the slam dunk that we thought and we have concerns.\n\n1. The town of Merced leaves much to be desired. While my wife and kid were at orientation, my goal was to check out the town. Not very vibrant. I can see the potential, but what’s holding it back? Being from the Midwest, it felt like a larger country town.\n\n2. During the intro calls, they indicated there was a regional airport available to get back to Southern California. Turns out that only sits 6-8 and tickets need to be purchased at least 4 months in advance.\n\n3. They also mentioned they can bring car. Turns out that needs a special exemption. That would leave my kid in the middle of nowhere with not great transport options.\n\n4. There’s a high first gen attendance rate. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but my kid was looking forward to finding more of an academic tribe. Not saying that’s not still possible, but seems like it will take a lot of legwork on their part.\n\n5. Some of the students my wife spoke with, alluded to terrible academic counseling and to expect a 4.5 year experience vs completion in 4 years.\n\nThe pros that I saw.\n\n1. The campus is beautiful and seems like it will cultivate learning and on campus social life.\n\n2. The new construction shows the investment taking place on campus.\n\n3. The move of sports from NAIA to Division 2 athletics is a good indicator of progress in my mind.\n\n4. It appears there will be plenty of research opportunities for them, but are staff capable of providing effective guidance.\n\nWith their AP and dual enrollment credits, my kid will be going in as a 2nd year, which is great. \n\nAs a parent, I just want them to be in the best spot for their success. I don’t want them to settle, especially since they didn’t apply, they were placed.\n\nAny help to alleviate our concerns? Thanks\n"

This is gender inclusive housing and we are all queer so you gotta be fine with that. I’m leaning towards someone who’s graduating in the fall or is in study abroad for the spring preferably, though at this point anyone can fill that fits Valley Terraces housing requirements.\n\nAlso lmk if I need to switch flairs, I didn’t know which one to use. Please spread the word if you can 🙏🙏🙏 You can contact me at lovettnoorani@ucmerced.edu for more details or inquiries.\n\nEdit: Realized I wrote “Spring 2025” instead of “Spring 2026”. My apologies \n\nEdit 2: As of June 30th 7:00 pm, have only gotten two inquiries and don't mind more inquiries for a bigger pool to choose from.

Production &amp; manufacturing of hardware &amp; semiconductors sounds neat! \n\nTo what extent does the program prepare students in terms of computer engineering? Is it more in name, is there more emphasis on one or the other, or does the curriculum strike a balance? Any insight would be appreciated!"

My name is Michael Moreno, and I am a freelance journalist currently covering a topic on recent graduates struggling to find a job post-college and wanted to hear from you.\n\nReports show that the job market isn't looking as hot, as unemployment rates have jumped to 5.8%: the highest since 2021. While there are many factors that indicate why the job market isn't plentiful, I want to hear from you.\n\nAll I ask is 20 minutes of your time to be interviewed over Zoom to talk about why you think you're having a tough time securing a job, what your options are right now and whether you feel college didn't set you up for the \"real world.\" If you're not comfortable with interviews but would like to share your insights, feel free to drop a comment below this post and share what's on your mind!\n\nIf you are interested in being interviewed, please private message me on here or on my Instagram @/thephotostage, and we'll discuss the logistics of the interview.\n\nI hope you all can share and help me achieve my goal of producing this story!\n\nThank you so much and have a great day!"

Does that mean I need to enroll in the class that the one i’m intending to register is linked to? \n2) How quickly do waitlists move? I’m used to them moving very quickly especially the last year because of the uptick in cc financial aid fraud/ghost students, but I can’t imagine that’s as big of an issue at UCM. My registration date isn’t til the end of June and most of the classes I want to register for are already full (with open waitlists though) \nThanks so much if you can answer either of these:) "

Anyway, I ended up taking three quarters of Calc instead of two (one semester) because the AB units were not covered by then. I got a C in the first quarter, a D in the second, then a C in the third (Calc BC). These are the lowest grades I've ever had; the rest of my grades are mostly As and occasional B's. \n\nApart from that, I've taken courses at my community college throughout high school (12 classes), same thing, As and Bs until Fall 2024. I got greedy, apart from AP Calc, I took AP Gov, Econ, and lit, and 3 college classes, theater, piano, and drawing 1. I got a D in drawing one (not the quality of work I submitted, but the quantity), but I plan to retake it this summer of 25. I submitted a course update to the school. Is there anything else I can do? \n\nThank you!"

An example is like CSE 31 having CSE 30 as a prerequisite but CSE 30 doesn't apply to any requirements I need so I'll just be taking it solely for the purpose of taking CSE 31. In total I have around 23 courses to take over 4 semesters (with maybe 1-3 classes overlapping some sections) so probably around 21. This is still a minimum of 5 classes a semester PLUS any course that doesn't even apply that I have to take as a prerequisite like I mentioned.\n\nThis just seems like a lot and for satisfying the Writing in the Discipline GE I have no idea how I'll take any of the courses without first taking 1 or 2 prerequisite courses.\n\nEDIT: I've realized that 2 upper div math courses satisfy 2 GE requirements as well + didn't realize 1 class was listed as 2 due to a lab. Total classes i'm looking at is 18 + 2-3 at minimum over 4 semesters. I think if I take 2 classes during the summer sessions that I'll be able to knock down the number I courses I need to take per semester to around 4 at the lowest."

        "body": "So I have been officially academically dismissed. Please read all of this, as I truly need help if this is worth appealing at this point. \n\nSo I transferred from a CC to UCM in 2023. I went through a lot in fall - spring of 2023-2024 and I did a educational leave which got approved for. Fall of 2024 comes and I got diagnosed with early cervical cancer. I did another educational leave which got approved again so I technically started over for the spring 2025 semester. I passed 3/4 classes but the one class I didn’t pass, I communicated for a whole month explaining my situation and how I needed one exam that I missed (which is worth all of my grade btw), and that if I could please make it up. Knowing that I obviously have help from my amazing counselor (Linda Safer), I did a meeting with her and explained that I couldn’t do in person classes and all my professors were okay with it and worked with me except this one professor. She said she would talk to him but he persisted with the “no makeup exams”. Which I get, but that was the only class I needed to pass all of my classes. Which led me to be academically dismissed. \n\nI went though a lot this semester as well: \n - mental health\n- physical health \n- being a single mother \n- being evicted and having to move 2 hours away from UCM \n- my son getting a UTI from a dishonest and ignorant daycare teacher\n- getting my phone stolen in mexico \n\nAnd I’m not sure how to even submit documents for the stuff that doesn’t even have documentation. I’m scared to submit solely a paragraph or a letter and NO documentation. What do I do? What would you do? Please help! "

Due to that they've unfortunately decided to most likely not apply to UCM because they think they'll have no chance getting in. We understand the mission to serve underserved areas, but I was wondering why not open it up more broadly? Wouldn’t expanding access increase the program’s visibility, attract more applicants, and help boost UC Merced’s reputation overall? Has anyone outside the region ever gotten in? Would love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has insight into how admissions works for this program. Thanks!"

        "body": "First, I want to share a bit about my background: I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Riverside and am currently a PhD student at UCLA. I was actually admitted to UCLA for undergrad as well, but I chose UC Riverside due to the cost of living. Although my tuition was covered—since I was raised in a low-income, single-parent household—living expenses in Los Angeles were significantly higher than in Riverside, and that played a major role in my decision.\n\nNow, as a PhD student at UCLA and a teaching assistant, I’ve had the chance to work closely with students. One thing I’ve observed is that, just like at UC Riverside, there are students here who are unmotivated or not particularly engaged. Of course, there are many incredibly bright and driven students at UCLA, but the idea that every student here is exceptional simply isn’t true. On average, I would say that students at UCLA tend to be more ambitious, but that doesn’t mean students at UC Riverside lack drive—it’s just a different overall environment.\n\nI’ve also served on admissions committees, where applications are typically reviewed by a mix of graduate students, retired counselors, and administrative staff—many of whom hold bachelor’s or master’s degrees from lesser-known institutions. Surprisingly, professors are rarely involved in the initial review process, as they are often focused on research. When faculty are involved, it’s usually lecturers or adjuncts—positions that unfortunately don’t carry the same weight or prestige as tenured roles. At times, I’ve questioned whether some admissions decisions truly reflect a deep understanding of a student’s potential.\n\nWhat I want to say is this: don’t be discouraged. Keep working hard. If you maintain strong grades and seek meaningful experiences, you’ll find success—regardless of which UC campus you attend.\n"

        "body": "Hey all, I'm a 24 y/o CS major who was initially set to transfer to Cal Poly Pomona since I got rejected or waitlisted from all the UCs I applied for. However, UC Merced allowed me to apply through their Count Me In program.\nI know CPP is supposed to offer a more \"hands-on\" approach while UCs provide more theoretical foundations for research, but I feel I wouldn't mind either. \n \nIn the case I'm accepted into UCM, I'd like to ask for any insight and things to consider in deciding between the two. \n \nI'm already in CPP's MEP program and applied for their Honors College after being invited to do so. Unsure if I'd get housing. I should get priority registration through accessibility services. Their financial aid estimates $14k a year in total expenses. \n \nIf UCM ends up offering more FA, I wonder if it'd end up being the better choice... but I hear a lot about the boredom people experience there. I'm no party person, but I still wonder how the quality of life would be like through an academic year. That said, I can also see the benefits of having UC resources and a relatively new campus without the similar competition and class sizes as one would typically expect. More of my credits might transfer towards my major, too, since I took Calc III + Linear Algebra &amp; Diff. EQs this Spring, and those classes either aren't required or don't fulfill a lower div for CS at CPP while they do at UCM. I also ideally wouldn't be staying at UCM for my entire undergrad since I've always wanted to study abroad for a year at some point.\n\nI know that people on this sub would probably be more biased towards UCM, but any thoughts would be appreciated! Especially regarding career outcomes (a little worried about being able to make the connections needed to find internships during undergrad or a job after graduating)."
