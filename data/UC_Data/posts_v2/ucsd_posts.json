Shifts get canceled constantly with no regard for workers‚Äô time or income. It sounds like an awful place to work.\n\nHopefully this reaches their corporate office.

Im a freshman at ucsd and since deciding to attend I feel like the school has done nothing but make me feel like they didn‚Äôt want me to actually accept. I have severe social anxiety to the point where I spent a large portion of my childhood unable to leave the house on my own. Despite this being very well documented, the Osd randomly ghosted me despite multiple calls and emails leaving me completely on my own in a triple dorm. Additionally, I have been on an anti-anxiety medication for years and almost had to go through withdrawals because the campus pharmacy would not respond to my requests to send my medication there. I live in a near constant state of anxiety because of how little privacy I have(resulting in me waking up constantly throughout the night) and have been showering multiple times a day just so my roommates wont hear me cry. On top of that I have a lot of uncommon food allergies and have had several scares with dining hall food to the point where Im forced to cook everything myself. Every place I reach out to sends me to someone else, and it feels like they don‚Äôt actually want to help and just want to get rid of me. I know I struggle to make friends and I was prepared for some level of isolation, but I haven‚Äôt had a word spoken to me in weeks and I somehow feel as though Im both too surrounded by people and too isolated? The whole reason I picked this school was for the quality of classes, but I am finding all the material to be shallower and easier than the stuff I learned in high school. In short im miserable and feel like Im not even getting the education I wanted to show for it. Does it get easier? Will my classes become more rigorous? I would love to hear from students with a few more years under their belt because Im finding it hard to make myself stay here. Im not looking for someone to tell me solutions to the problems I‚Äôve faced so far, im looking for someone to give me something to maybe look forward to."

You can roll the dice with abstract insight as people talk about \"where the field is going\" but:\n\nA) expect all your peers to have heard the same thing so it is not beneficial to you as one person in a competitive group,\n\nB) people don't really get hired by the field, they get hired by PIs and lab managers, and\n\nC) the NIH is being dismantled by Nazis, meaning the competition is going to radically ramp up. Departments will likely cut their intakes or switch to admitting every other year (or both), multi-year grants have to be funded in lump sums so they're gonna be way harder to get, etc. It's dark and you will need to be agile about it."

I'm a first year so I know I have time and what not, but I've never struggled to make friends before. I consider myself somewhat extroverted and I went to at least 1 welcome week event every day in week 0, but i still somehow have no friends. I keep talking to people and then they never respond or follow up on plans, and I don't want to keep chasing after people who, in all honesty, don't really seem that keen on being friends. I'm trying my best to be positive but it's just getting hard as I see all my suitemates making friends so easily, and I don't want this to come of in the wrong way, but I was literally the one who went up to people and introuced all of my suitemates and whatnot to other groups when out and about. My point is that nobody really comes up to me if that makes sense, it's just  so defeating that I have to keep chasing people and nothing ever comes out of it, and I've been to a few club things but it's the same way. I really felt it yesterday which is why I'm posting now ig lol, but all of my suite mates were out with their own friends and there I was just sitting in bed on my phone alone, and then when I went out to get some air everybody was with their friends. Outside of my dorm, I genuinely have 4 friends, 2 of which are from before sd and out of the other 2, one of them hasn't reached out in like 2 weeks after I kept making every plan. AGAIN i really don't want this to come off as me begging for pity, but I just don't know what I'm doing wrong lol also im a female first year and i'm lowk chopped cheese so maybe that's part of the problem üò≠"

I've taken Calc 1, 2, 3, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and am currently doing statistics/probability theory. I have yet to take stochastic processes, but what I'm concerned about is that the UCSD bioinformatics PhD program (even the BMI track that I'm interested in) seems to be very CS-heavy and requires background in data structures and algorithms, which I don't have. However, I watched the 2023 admissions video and some of the students said that basic familiarity with CS is adequate, so if anyone has more insight, I'd appreciate it. \n\nAs of now, I'm not sure what I want to do for my career because at this point I'm open to anything, but I'm particularly interested in genetic epidemiology, analyzing a wide range of patient genetic and epidemiological data to improve medical treatments. Just wanted to put this out there for more context."

He walked into the Urban Plates patio, which is closed until 11 AM. The whole thing felt really off ‚Äî especially at that hour.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen him around. The last time was around 10:30 PM near Ralphs in the same area. He was wearing the same outfit and mask, with both hands in his pockets, walking between cars and hiding behind them like he was trying not to be seen. It really creeped me out.\n\nI just want to remind everyone ‚Äî especially students and people walking alone ‚Äî to stay aware of your surroundings. We‚Äôve all heard about the recent incident with a man in a lion mask at La Jolla Shores attacking someone, so please be careful out there.\n\nStay safe, everyone.\n"

Begs his mom to let him double major in Physics. Then last year, he says he's done with undergrad and is taking PhD courses online. I have no idea when he actually last set foot on campus physically. One of those stay in his room 24/7 in a bathrobe people. He hasn't taken a campus class physically since before Covid hit. His mother was so happy he got accepted. Well...not so fast, see below. \n\nSo yesterday I go on a mountain bike group ride, one of the riders is a PhD math student. I say my stepson is also in the program and taking online classes. He says there are no online graduate classes in math. He then looks up the student's name on the graduate directory...it's missing. I text my wife that we need to talk about this. She confronts him and he does admit that 'technically' he's not in the PhD program yet. \n\nHere is his plan and please tell me how whacked out this is, or if it could actually work: UCSD allows 5.5 years or 200 credits before forcing graduation (or kicking them out). If he double majored, I assume that's 11.0 years and 400 credits? He's been there since 2017 so he has until 2028 to finalize everything? He'll be 33 years old in 2 months BTW... Graduate school is $20K a year. His plan is to take as many PhD courses as he can (if he is indeed really taking ANY of them online) as an undergrad who as a scholarship and doesn't pay for classes. If he can take two years of classes and get those out of the way, and pass the qualifying exam, then in theory he only has two years left for a dissertation and he saves $40K for not having to pay for four years. \n\nIMO it's a really f-ed up way to go about trying to save $40K. If it works, and he gets his PhD and actually moves out and gets a postdoc somewhere, all will be more or less forgiven. I personally think it will not work; first of all he never even applied for the program and there is no guarantee he will be accepted. He does have other offers in Texas and Florida as a backup (out of state tuition of course). \n\nCan he really take most/all of his PhD classes still enrolled as an undergrad? And are any graduate classes online, especially in math?"

But, academically, I have never been so stressed in my life and that‚Äôs coming from someone who excelled in high school.

I‚Äôm taking 12 so I could get used it and I am ahead due to taking dual enrollment in high school. But, I‚Äôm constantly drained and I never feel like I‚Äôm doing enough.

Whenever I‚Äôm in class I‚Äôm so locked in and then I look around and people are just having convos or on their phones like are they just crazy smart? I am struggling and my major is also known to not be that hard, it‚Äôs cogs sci spec. in neuro. I just am so stressed right now. I literally wake up with my heart pumping with anxiety! My dad told me that the first year is going to be the hardest and now I understand why. But, I feel so guilty for feeling this way because there‚Äôs people working a job and taking harder classes or doing a harder degree in general and here I am complaining.

Long term goal, I want to break into higher ed. For now, I still plan on pursing a master's program, post the gap year.

Join PRENSA...PRENSA stands for \"Pre-Nursing Student Association\". We guide and shed light on a community of pre-nursing students here at UCSD. You don't necessarily have to be pre-nursing; we invite anyone with pre-health interests. We host GBMs, socials, volunteer, internships, and more opportunities. Our main goal for this year is giving back to the UCSD and San Diego community by doing more hands-on work. Whether that is making care packages for the homeless, care packages for UCSD students, or taking trips to Tijuana to volunteer at clinics there as well. This may be a great opportunity for you if you're looking for a pre-health organization that is not as populated as others, making it more likely for you to gain experience. Most of our board members have certifications such as CNA, MA, and Med Tech...we guide out members on the path of getting certifications that you can have before expanding your education post bachelors. Get hands-on clinical experience by letting us mentor you on where to get your certification, what places to apply, and more. Through collaboration, mentorship, and advocacy efforts, members will enhance their understanding of the healthcare field, promote a commitment towards compassionate care, and support each other‚Äôs journey towards becoming empathetic healthcare professionals with obtained knowledge, insight, and information surrounding the field of nursing.\n\n  \nAt our first GBM you will find out about a volunteer opportunity for this Sunday 10/26 &amp; an upcoming social event! \n\nFIRST GBM TUESDAY 10/21 TOMORROW @ CENTER HALL \n\nROOM NUMBER WILL BE DISCLOSED 45MIN BEFORE GBM STARTS @ 6:30PM ON OUR INSTAGRAM!!\n\nPRENSA INSTAGRAM --&gt; @ PRENSAUCSD\n\n"

Being the vain mofo I am, I was down. \n\nFor some reason I decided to show up in these terrible ass 2000s extra long jean shorts. Don‚Äôt judge me. Baggy was in back then. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt. Idk. üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nAnyways I don‚Äôt know if it before or after the cookout, but around that time this young lady and ai became the faces of diversity at UCSD. \n\nThis picture showed up in every other article about UCSD for probably 2 years. \n\nAlso shoutout to the dude on the bike. I think he was on the tennis team or fencing team. "

        "body": "READ FULLY PLEASE: \n\nHey everyone! I‚Äôm a psychology major at UCSD, and this is my last year here. I‚Äôve been a bit shy and haven‚Äôt really put myself out there as much as I should have. I‚Äôm not looking to be best friends with anyone, but I‚Äôd love to make some cool friends before I graduate. I‚Äôd love to hang out with people I can actually be friends with outside of UCSD. I‚Äôm a female, so I‚Äôd love female friends! Males are okay too, as long as you‚Äôre really cool and not weird. I‚Äôm a transfer student, which is part of the reason why it‚Äôs been so hard for me to put myself out there. I don‚Äôt really commute often, but I‚Äôve been feeling a little lonely. I‚Äôm a big fan of trying new things and exploring new places. I‚Äôm thinking of going on some hikes around here, and I‚Äôve always been interested in trying ‚Äúextreme‚Äù activities that would probably make most people SH**T themselves. Basically, I don‚Äôt want to be friends with anyone who‚Äôs too scared to live their life. I get scared too, but I want to meet friends who will challenge us to step outside our comfort zones. Of course, there will be boundaries at first, but I really want to meet friends who are as adventurous as I am (YOLO). Another thing I‚Äôve been wanting to do is go to HHN. I‚Äôve been there before, but it wasn‚Äôt as much fun because no one made me feel comfortable enough to be there with them. I really want to have a friend who we can laugh together all night long. I‚Äôm a bit weird, but in a really good way‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not looking specifically for a psychology major friend, but it would be preferred just because I struggle sometimes in school, and having a friend in that major would make me feel more sane. \n\nSomething I‚Äôd like to mention though is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the type of person who sometimes needs a little space, so there might be times when I don‚Äôt respond right away or even go a couple days without texting. Please don‚Äôt take it personally! It has nothing to do with me not liking you or not wanting to be friends, I just get really focused or overwhelmed with school/life and accidentally go quiet. That being said, I‚Äôm still serious about making real friendships. We don‚Äôt have to talk every single day to be close, but if we do end up clicking and talking all the time, I‚Äôm totally down for that too. I just wanted to put it out there so no one feels ignored or unappreciated. I value quality over constant texting, and I love friendships where we can pick up right where we left off, and still go on fun/adventurous plans together."

        "body": "First yr and faced w rejections from the bigger eng clubs on campus, I was looking for advice on what I should do. I dont have any specific engineering focused experiences so I'm trying to go to the human-powered-submarine meetings (but surprisingly there r barely any people there? not to shit on the club but it seems like members just settled for it bc they also got rejected from everything like me), and im debating trying out for some SE clubs but I just don't know what to do; club apps lowk are closed and I did my best, and I want to make the most out of club experiences.\n\n Ik there is always next year but if I get rejected solely based on my resume and answers to questions, I would most likely need more/better experiences to talk about?\n\n  \nAny opinions, advice? I want to actually learn stuff that could then help me land a job/internship later on."
