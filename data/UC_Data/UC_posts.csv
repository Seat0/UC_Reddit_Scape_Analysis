Rethinking Bio Sci/ PA school,RepulsiveBag4710,1761693972,0,1,/r/UCI/comments/1oioyjo/rethinking_bio_sci_pa_school/,,,"Hi! Any and all advice would be helpful! 
I’m a second year bio sci student, My current GPA is 3.2 with my major/STEM GPA being a 2.8 (ik yikes),  I’m rethinking of becoming a PA as of recently because I’ve having trouble with my grades, especially in chem. In general chemistry I got Straight C+s while getting a D+ in 1C but retaking in summer. I’m in OChem, Bio, and Calc 5A so I think my gpa is just going to get worse from here :/ 

My midterms scores are just below average, and I don’t think any PA school in CA will take me, due to my GPA. I’ve been job hunting but I’ve been working at Starbucks for almost a year, which isn’t medical related at all. I love biology and I want to make a difference in healthcare, but I’m just feeling incredibly lost and overwhelmed as a first gen student. I’m not sure what to do anymore. ",uci

ochem midterm,Bubbly-Albatross-125,1761626240,4,9,/r/UCI/comments/1oi0f40/ochem_midterm/,,,"I just got back my midterm score for vanderwal 51A and did not do well. The class avg (71%) was surprisingly high from what I have read about his previous classes. I missed small points on like the curve arrows because I drew them the wrong way.

A bit of yap. I'm a second year rn and I've been struggling in chem and bio so much, it's genuinely making me rethink pursuing medical school even though medicine was the only career path I ever wanted to pursue. High school was so much easier imo and I took AP classes. My GPA is a 3.7 right now, but I've already had to retake chem 1C over the summer. I don't even think medical schools would give my application a chance after I take all the required stem classes.

Switching Out of BioSci,Weird-Chance-7089,1761623660,8,15,/r/UCI/comments/1ohznt1/switching_out_of_biosci/,,,"Hello everyone, I am genuinely looking for some advice or pointers! I know I'm falling into the category of ""failed biology"", though I understand that I genuinely dislike it regardless of my standing. I formally spoke to the Biological Sciences counselors recently, being told not to switch due to primarily doing well. However, upon completing the labs, personal onsite training, and even career exploration, I realized I truly do not like it. 

I originally pursued biology to have a chance at working within the Biotech field, a former love and sentiment in which I shared with many. Though now, even though I truly do reside with the use of medical technology within the sciences, I realized I can't see myself spending my time in a laboratory all day. Additionally, everyone around me is insanely smart and extremely competitive. I understand I may not be cut out for the work, especially with he lack of enjoyment I feel towards it. 

Sorry if I branched out into more of a tangent, but what I attempted to convey is still true. My love for this major is somewhat dwindling, and the load for something I am hesitant and directionless towards doesn't seem worth it for me. I've been somewhat degraded and looked down upon by my friends, taking the major, seeing it as weakness/laziness. Weakness it may be, but I don't love it nor see myself doing well onward. 

Any advice from any upperclassmen who switched? Any suggestions on what to switch into, considering the completed courses (lower division chemistry and the biology series)? For anyone who switched, what helped you realize? If you didn't switch but took some time completing the degree, please tell me! I want to hear genuine stories, even if I understand it may provide a reality check for me.",uci

I’m a 26F, a student at saddleback college, and I work part time. I am planning on moving into a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath house in South OC, 
and I am looking for two other people (preferably women, gay men, or others in the lgbt community) to move in with me. No couples and no children. There are 3 rooms available- $1150 (small) and $1300 (large) with a shared bathroom. And $1700 with a private bathroom. The rooms are unfurnished. Utilities will be split equally. I want either the $1300 room or $1150 room. My dad will be my co-signer and we’ll all get your own separate lease.

I’m down to be friends but I will also respect your boundaries if you don’t want to. The most important thing is that we get along. I’d like us to meet up before moving in. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Idc what you do but smoking isn’t allowed in any part of the house (landlady’s rules). Id prefer to live with no tobacco smokers. I am strict on no vaping inside the house. Pets aren’t allowed either. 

What I look for in roommates:

- LGBT friendly 
- cleans up after themselves
- Will do assigned common area chores each week (we’ll switch it up). I want us all to be considerate about the chores and communicate respectfully (no micromanaging) 
- If you’re sharing a bathroom with me, I’d like us to alternate weeks for cleaning it. 
- Doesn’t smoke or vape inside 
- Is quiet if their roommates need to sleep during reasonable hours
- Is ok with having people over (including overnight guests) sometimes but doesn’t have people over all the time. I don’t want the house to be constantly filled with people or for your partner to be here constantly as if they are living there
- Communicates well and respectfully
- Recognizes that we are all equals. We all want to be fair and no one matters more than anyone else. 
- Is ok with me talking on the phone. I’m not an unreasonably loud person but I like to talk on the phone a lot. 
- Idc if you sleep in but if someone is up and making noise at reasonable hours and it wakes you up, wear headphones or earplugs. 
- Is ok with the AC used during the hotter times and the heat being used if it’s cold.
- Will actually use the dishwasher as a dishwasher and not use it as a drying rack. I will buy a drying rack if you want to hand wash all your dishes. 
- Is ok with sharing cookware (totally get it if you have allergies or celiac but other than that, let’s maximize space in the kitchen) 
- Is ok with having a general rule of no doing laundry past a certain hour depending on when everyone goes to sleep.

i keep hearing contradictory statements about this, where some chem tutors told me this is a lie and he usually does curve at the end of the quarter; some people saying their courses weren't curved at all. at this point my theory is that he does a curve for the more advanced courses, but for chem 1a, 1b, maybe 1c (?) he doesn't curve.

i've also heard he offers extra credit, but from what he's said so far, it's not really extra credit, moreso ""you'll get repeat questions on the next midterm"", which is nice - but it still doesn't ""make up"" for a terrible first exam, if that makes sense. like it doesn't add any extra points for you.

if someone who has taken shaka for the beginning chem series, 1a - 1c, can please let me know if this is true or not, i'd be eternally grateful. i'm at my wits end trying to guess if my grade will be fine or not and i'm so stressed it's insane. i just need to know if he does curve, or does offer \*real\* extra credit. because if not i don't think my grade can recover lol.",uci

Withdrawing from CHC,Relative_Capital6329,1761583971,11,8,/r/UCI/comments/1ohjrdw/withdrawing_from_chc/,,,"Hi all, I am a first year here at UCI and I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with dropping CHC after fall quarter. I don't reallty have any interest in continuing bc I don't really want to pursue research and a thesis necessarily because I wish to become a teacher or work as a social worker (I am still figuring this out too). I also want to graduate in 3 years, and it just seems that it may get hectic trying to complete honors at the same time. I already have lower division writing credit from AP Lang and Lit, and most of my other GEs are fulfilled through other transfer credit so dropping HumCore cannot hurt my progress. I should note I technically have sophomore status bc of all the transfer credits I have through AP or Dual Credit so my class registration shouldn't be that bad right? I'm working on switching my degree to Ed Sci with a history minor.

Essentially, my main question here is how should I withdraw? Can I still register for winter classes with CHC priority and just drop it once winter quarter hits so my classes don't get dropped? Also, will I get kicked out of honors housing (my main concern, though I don't think they would do this. Also, housing guarentee ik I would lose but I plan to get an ACC apartment next year anyways).

Despite facing unique challenges, they train tirelessly, embodying the spirit of BMX racing. Recognizing their efforts and providing a global platform to compete would not only be a significant victory for these athletes but also a step forward for the world of sports in acknowledging and celebrating diversity

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would I be able to defer this loan or would a private loan be my only option to get re-enrolled? Any advice or insight would really help, I’m super stressed trying to figure this out.

We’re a small group of 5 students looking for more people to join us for some casual soccer or volleyball games once a week here at UCI. Nothing competitive or serious — just for fun, exercise, and meeting new people.

All skill levels are welcome, both graduate and undergraduate, from complete beginners to experienced players. We’ll figure out the day and time each week based on everyone’s availability (probably using Discord or a similar app).

If you’re interested, drop a comment below or send me a DM so we can invite you to the group.

Also — does anyone know if there’s already an existing casual UCI soccer or volleyball group doing something similar? Would love to join or collaborate instead of duplicating efforts.

In the parking pass email it literally says this:

“Thank you for your UCI parking purchase!
Upon arrival, your license plate serves as your permit, there is no need to print this confirmation.  
For reference, your transaction details are included below:”

Then UCI emails me this:

“After reviewing the information you provided and the details of the citation, we are unable to grant a full dismissal of the citation.

We acknowledge that you were a first time visitor; therefore the citation will be cancelled for a fee of $16.00, the cost of a daily parking permit. As stated on campus and lot entrance signs, a valid permit must be displayed or vehicle registered at all times.”

Maybe they shouldn’t have conflicting information? I literally did what their parking staff told me to do and then they cited me for parking when I paid for 24 hours and now are basically refusing to waive it. Any judge would throw this out in a traffic court room easily.

It’s my last year here at UCI and it feels like I don’t really know anyone. I’m in a very small major so I already know everyone in my classes (basically everyone is taken), and I don’t really know how to expand outside of that.

I’m looking for ways that I can meet new people because I want to try sleeping around in my last year. I’ve been in long-term relationships before (so I’m not inexperienced lmao) and I have been told (both by my gfs and other girls) that I look good and have a funny and kind personality.

I’m just not sure how to start. School clubs always felt weird because people focus mostly on their work rather than socializing (which is fine, you went to a club to do that lmao) and I don’t really feel that’s the right environment.

I could uber to some of the college bars, but they’re probably gonna be too loud for me and I don’t feel comfortable approaching random women because that feels kinda weird and objectifying. They’re minding their own business and dancing, why am I interrupting? I’ve been told that I don’t set off the creep alarm so that’s something ig but it still feels weird. I’m very inexperienced when it comes to bar culture and would like some help.

I’m not sure where else to look, honestly. I heard that UCI is a dead school when I first came here and I didn’t really care at the time but now I’m missing it. I want to try short term relationships and sleeping around to see if I like it but just have no idea where to start.

It can feel overwhelming, and it’s not always easy to find where you fit in or meet the right people. I definitely last year as a freshman.

If you’ve been looking for a space that’s welcoming, supportive, and genuine, I’d like to invite you to check out **Kesem at UCI**.

We’re a student-run club that supports kids whose parents have been impacted by cancer, but along the way we’ve built a close and caring community here on campus. Many of us joined not knowing anyone, and Kesem quickly became a place where we could feel at home.

You don’t need any experience, and you don’t need to know anyone coming in. We're open to all students. If you’re looking for friends, a way to get involved, or just a group of people who care, you’re always welcome here.

Our meetings are **Every Wednesday from 6-7 pm in Steinhaus Hall 174**, and you’re welcome to just show up. Or if you’d prefer, feel free to message me whether you want to hear more about Kesem or you just want someone to reach out to and talk with at UCI.

The only time where every page is there, is when I press download submission in the bottom right corner. 

Unfortunately the prof doesn’t grade this way and every page needs to be viewable thru gradescope submission.



Any advice is truly appreciated, for reference I use Goodnotes and converted the hw into pdf there, uploaded it to my phone, and then used my phone to upload the assignment to gradescope. I also tried different ways, uploading from computer and iPad directly but no luck. Thank you!!

I enjoy my birthday but also it’s the worst day in the year. I don’t have many friends bc of personal reasons and also cutting them out of my life for several years and as always, everyone forgets my birthday and when they do tell me hbd, it’s always days earlier or after my birthday and I kinda got used to no one telling me happy birthday. I’m huge on birthdays but it seems when it comes to my friend’s birthday and I go all out, I never get the same response as I want to. And I know what you may be thinking “ oh they’re bad friends you should cut them out” and it’s not necessarily that I think, I don’t think they’re bad friends bc they have been there when I needed them on my hard days but when it comes to my one day where it’s all about me, it’s like the world goes quiet and forgets about. I went to celebrate my birthday early at a theme park a few days ago to celebrate my birthday early which was fun and it felt better than today, well duh bc it was a theme park and it was fun but that day felt more like a birthday than today. My parents are getting up there in age and my dad kinda forgot my birthday when I woke up. We kinda have this tradition where they hang up balloons and stuff but this year he didn’t and instead focused on cleaning stuff and as I was leaving to get cfa to make me feel better he’s like “it’s ur birthday today huh” and it just makes me feel lonely and invisible. Not even my own dad who calls me his best friend remembers my birthday. I work at a school and my MT gave me a balloon and some money which is more than my parents and idk, it seems like people who have more money n care abt me, acknowledge me more. 

I live in oc but in the poor areas and I know my parents are trying their best even with financial struggles but we have always made it so our birthdays are the best but today when i am entering my 20’s, it doesn’t feel like I wanna be alive anymore. I don’t wanna kms bc I don’t but I just want all this pain to go away. 

I just wish one day I can get to what I wanna be career wise and earn money and live far away from the neighborhood and city I currently live in. Living here makes me remember that if I keep living there, I just won’t amount to anything bc all the people that live there, are people that dropout and have fucked up their lives.

I just wished that when my birthday came and I turned 20, my life would start all over and people would care for me but I guess I can only dream and hope that wish comes true one day and I can be what I wanna be when I grow up and graduate from here. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been crying for the past 3 hours just bc I don’t like how everyone around me has a better life than me and have people who care about them very much and tell them hbd and shit. Everything I own rn, I have bought w my hardworking money bc ik my parents can’t afford helping me anymore even tho they say they’ll help me with anything. 

I went through a really hard depression era back in HS and even though I have gotten better , I still have moment where I shut down or just become quiet and stuff and rn , I just feel nothing. I feel numb and sad and depressed and feel nothing. On a day where it’s suppose to be about me, I feel lonely inside and just wanna curl up hide and become invisible. 

I kinda went on a tangent and was all over the place, but if you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Tuition Question,Euphoric-Panda3711,1760204408,4,2,/r/UCI/comments/1o41rgk/tuition_question/,,,"I'm currently a junior in high school, set to graduate a year early in August 2026. I reside in the DC Metropolitan area, and I don't see any other universities I would want to attend that aren't in California. I want to study and eventually live long-term as I see more opportunities for myself there, both academically and professionally.

My original plan was to graduate early, move to Los Angeles to live with my older sibling, and enroll immediately in a community college. However, after extensive research, I’ve found that proving financial independence for in-state tuition would be nearly impossible, as I would be unemployed and relying on an out-of-state 529 plan to pay for community college and later transfer to UCI. Besides financial independence, I meet every other residency requirement, such as physical presence, intent, and immigration status.

To strengthen my residency case, I’ve considered registering to vote in California, obtaining a driver’s license, and registering my car there. Doing all this, though, still doesn't fix the dependency issue, so I created a new plan. I’m considering taking a gap year after graduating early to work part-time and support myself by covering rent, food, and transportation. This could help me establish genuine financial independence before enrolling in a California community college. Could this plan make me eligible for in-state tuition?

Please let me know, thanks.

As you may have been able to gather, I’m interning as a writer for the University Life section of the UCI 2025-2026 Anthology yearbook. I’m currently conducting interviews of current undergraduate students with on campus jobs to be included in the book! 

Requirements: 
• currently enrolled undergraduate at UCI
• working an ON CAMPUS job while attending
• Unfortunately due to the fact that there is extensive coverage in other sections/pages my request is not including:
- ASUCI
- Yearbook
- Brandywine dining hall
- Anteatery dining hall

Additionally, I will probably be asking for some kind of verification that you attend and work on campus (just because there isn’t really a verification system in place on this subreddit). Nothing extensive, I won’t ask for your student ID number or financial aid letter or anything of a sensitive nature like that. Probably just like a CANVAS screenshot and a job offer letter (with some job info redacted is totally acceptable).

I’ve met some colleagues on here so I thought it was worth a shot to seek anyone on here that would like for some of their story to be told (:

Okay, thanks for considering, please do send me a private message (DM) if you are interested. In any case, good luck or resonating blessings this year!

¡Chao!

I feel like I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about UCI being socially dead and that it’s hard to date or something and they’re not wrong, but I also feel like that it gets a lot better as time goes on. 

When I was a freshman I felt like I had no one to talk to, and was cooped up in my room studying or working. I felt like every attempt of making friends for a whole year ended in superficial relationships or small talk that never really meant anything, but I kept trying (because dropping out wasn’t really an option) and eventually I found a group of really solid people I spend all my time with!

For anyone feeling like they’re having a hard time making friends or stressing over finals, keep on trying!! You only ever fail if you give up, and theres nothing to lose from an awkward conversation or even a rejection. Be bold, have conversations, go complement someone’s outfit, ask if you can sit with someone outside (too many tables are being used for a single person). Be the living in a socially dead world

I'm a year 1 undergraduate student from Hong Kong and my department (physics) offers exchange spots to UCB for Jan 2027 ~ Aug 2027, which I'm heavily considering signing up for. I have some questions about this uni and California:

- The current political state and safety of the US is a big concern for me, though I've heard that California is better than other parts of the US. It's difficult to predict what will happen in 2027, but I wonder whether California currently is safe/welcoming to Chinese students and whether violence/crime is a prominent issue?

- Apparently I'll have to search for my own living space. I wonder if finding living space in that area might be difficult, and if it might be very expensive?

- If anyone who is studying / studied undergrad physics in UCB might be reading this, I wonder if the physics courses there might be very hard or have very high workload? 

Would also appreciate if there's any other info that might be useful to know!",berkeley

Roommate pisses me off,Longjumping_Pie_2344,1761510164,39,77,/r/berkeley/comments/1oguwdy/roommate_pisses_me_off/,,,"My roommate is always in our room. At first it was fine because I’m usually out, but there’s days when I want to study in the room, mainly during the evening before bed. The problem is, I literally can’t study. She is so noisy. Even when she isn’t talking, she literally taps on her mousepad 24/7 which makes such bothersome noise and if she isn’t tapping her mousepad on her laptop, she’s typing nosily on her keyboard. It’s so distracting and it drives me crazy. Like I’ve never once seen her not type or tap. 

During midterm season, she’d make so much distracting noise that I literally spend hours on campus just to avoid coming back. Yesterday when it was raining like crazy, I had to haul myself onto campus even though I’d rather just study in my PJs in the comfort of my room.

And she’s always in the room. It’s so weird because we have an apartment. She refuses to eat dinner anywhere other than in our room even if it’s messy food or food that’ll stink up the place. I caught her last week during a super hot day eating Kim chi soup with the windows completely shut and door closed. She was sweating and dying of heat but refused to leave the room even though the room was so hot and filled with her food aroma. 

I’ve never once seen her willingly leave the apartment and if she does, it’s only for an hour or two. It drives me crazy because it occurred to me that she only sees me in the room at night on weekdays. She gets the whole room to herself on weekdays and weekends because I go home on weekends or I’m spending the whole day outside on weekdays and come back after dark. 

To sum it up, she practically lives in that apt alone cause I’m never there. I used to stay at Berkeley on weekends before I realized I couldn’t stand being around her because she was always at our place. It’s annoying because I hate going home and want to stay at Berkeley, but I cannot stand always seeing her in that room. Is it wrong for me to secretly wish that she would spend less time in our room?? I was fine at first before I started realizing that she does everything in that room and refuses to leave it.

As a transfer and lifelong fan, I’ve noticed that while Memorial’s student sections overflowed early this season, most of campus still feels detached. I tried to unpack why that is — and how new leadership under Ron Rivera and Rich Lyons might shift the narrative.

Curious what other students and alumni think: does Berkeley’s academic intensity make it harder for us to buy into school spirit?

I’ve only stayed here because of my roommate/best friend since it’s in his budget, if not we would’ve been gone after our first year. 

The furniture, management, and overall building is shitty. I’ve been woken up by the fire alarms more than my own alarm. I’ve had to wait months for things to be repaired like my sink. Anytime I mention an issue or complain, management immediately pushes it under the rug. They tell you it’s affordable rent but then charge you like crazy for extra things that you don’t even sign for. Then they say they can’t even remove it. 

The walls are thin and I’ve heard my upstairs neighbor moaning dude. There’s also crackheads that live here and they sell drugs in the building. The employees know and do nothing about it. 

If you’re looking for housing, look elsewhere. You’ll regret living here after the first month.

If the cops did their job to arrest her, great, but it seemed excessive and just an unnecessary move to have done that with their car, if it was just to shame her. They could have just parked the car and have her handcuffed in the back seat while interrogating her or asking her her questions and reminding her her Miranda rights…

The former is basically the next step up from FSW, and Student Supervisor is the highest position (so I was told).

I’m gonna be a senior next year, which doesn’t give me a lot of time to get promoted to supervisor, but I really wanna try if I do have a chance. Are there any Crew leaders or student supervisors at any of the dining halls on campus (current or former) that can shed some light on the process?

I've heard tons of varying stuff about whether GPA or essays matter most, and ultimately it just feels like there's a lot of variance in the admissions process.

1) Went to the ER for a dental tooth abscess 
2) Went to the ER for high blood pressure 
3) Got denied dental treatment due to high blood pressure 
4) Doctor can’t find the source of the high blood pressure

10) Left my dog at home when he was my source of happiness

Even after that, staff had to keep going into the crowd throughout the night. I counted at least 5 or 6 incidents. It was honestly wild!

If you’re planning to camp out, please take care of yourselves. Bring food and water, drink electrolytes, and pack cooling items like mini fans. They’re super cheap and make a big difference. I get that some things are out of our control, but staying hydrated and prepared is important, especially when you're standing for hours in tightly packed crowds where it gets hot fast. It sucks that people didn’t fully get to experience the concert because they had to see the medical team because they were having medical emergencies. 

As someone who goes to concerts pretty regularly, I’ve truly never seen anything like what happened last night. Take care of yourselves out there

Fast forward to yesterday at 5 PM in Evans Hall: I got the test, read through every question, and it was tough, but I had a plan for how to tackle it and manage the math.(my weakness) Then, worse than I could’ve imagined… **the pep rally started.**

It was awful. The MC was screaming into the mic, blasting high-energy songs. I started crying right there, trying to wipe my tears before they hit the paper. I just couldn’t concentrate. I kept trying to calm down and refocus, but I couldn’t recall the intricate math details I’d worked so hard to learn. I know I failed. I ended up leaving the midterm in tears.

I’m still feeling really down, plagued with imposter syndrome. This is mostly a rant, but if anyone’s ever had a testing disaster and bounced back, I’d love to hear how you recovered. I could use some encouragement right now.

I need to complain about RSF,Intelligent-Station1,1760749925,27,156,/r/berkeley/comments/1o9iouk/i_need_to_complain_about_rsf/,,,"Let me start by saying that I am qualified to speak on this issue because this is my second time at Cal after finishing undergrad in 2016 (I’m getting my MA currently). The RSF has made virtually zero improvements to any part of the space in almost ten years, and I’m completely over it. I don’t even know where to start. 

Let’s talk about the size. I’m no expert on university gyms, but for the size of Berkeley, this gym feels comically small - hence, why it’s packed at all hours. Someone mentioned in another post that while the student body grows every year, the RSF stays the same. There are the ten or so smaller rooms on the cardio floor (which could be consolidated and made into a larger functional space) but at least half of them are completely empty and unused at all times. It makes absolutely no sense. 

Next, the machines. Oh my god. Not only are most of them old, but at any given time in the weight room, expect 10% of the machines to be broken or defective in some way (this applies to the cardio machines, too). 

Now let’s talk about cleanliness. The place STINKS. There are minimal fans running and zero AC. The weight room gets extremely stuffy and smells like a$$, and the mirrors on the wall are consistently dirty and grimy. I get the sense that the place hasn’t been properly sanitized in years. Half of the wet wipe stations are always empty. 

I’m not sure if this is a public university issue or something entirely different, but I’m astounded at how awful RSF is these days. I visited my sister once at Cal Poly and the gym was an absolute dream. 

I love Berkeley, I really do (why else would I be here for a second time), but the RSF is an absolute embarrassment. The money to improve the facility exists, it’s just clearly not a priority.

Thank you everyone I appreciate you all so much!! I got it from U Dessert earlier today. If I’m just responding to you I’m sorry - I immediately went to take a midterm 😭]

Hey Berkeley,

I'm reaching out because I'm honestly heartbroken and need your help.

I lost my mother's watch somewhere around Berkeley on Thursday, October 9th. The clasp was loose and it just fell off without me noticing - I didn't realize until the next day when I went to check the time.

This watch isn't just a watch to me. My mom wore this every single day for over 20 years. Seeing it on my wrist reminds me of her and keeps me connected to her. Losing it feels like I've lost a piece of her.

**What it looks like:**

* Brand: Citizen Quartz (says ""CITIZEN QUARTZ"" on the face)
* Style: Dainty women's dress watch with a rectangular/elongated face
* Band: Gold-tone metal bracelet with a delicate link pattern
* Face: White/cream textured dial with gold hands and simple hour markers
* Size: Small/petite women's watch, very lightweight
* The watch has a classic, elegant vintage look

**Where I was that day:** Downtown Berkeley

I know Berkeley is a big place and this is probably a needle in a haystack, but this community has always come through for people. I've seen you all reunite people with lost pets, wallets, and even keys.

If you were walking around Ace Apartments on October 9th and saw a watch on the ground, or if you work at a business in the area and someone turned one in - please, please DM me.

It’s still in the process of being built. My roommates and I went in for a tour, and the ""tour"" was just the staff showing us some generated pictures of what the apartment could look like on a tablet, and walking us through some model designs of beds, kitchen counters, fridges, etc that were in the office. I am a little bit skeptical because we haven't seen the building in real life, we don't know how big one room is, and they're also SO SO desperate to get us to sign (they offered us a $250 visa gift card if we signed a lease within the next 72 hours, which I feel like would not be the smartest idea). For the floor plans that they have available, it's $999 per month per person to share a triple. I think it’s a little expensive but maybe not entirely undoable. But I do feel like it would be kinda silly to sign a lease for a house we haven’t even seen. Has anyone else gone on tours as well? What do you guys think? Am I being overly skeptical?",berkeley

At the same time I don't want to lose my spot here. I was hoping to renew around feb/march next yr (assuming all is well).

I don’t usually make posts like this, but I just felt like speaking a bit.

I went back home for a semester (I’m international), and it’s been, too weirdly quiet. Being away from campus made me realize how much life there actually gives me: the noise, the stress, the random small talks after class, friends, even just walking through campus half-asleep for an 8am lecture. It all felt tiring in the moment, but now I’d give anything to be there again.

At home, everything’s slower. My friends are busy with their own things, and the days start blending into each other. I miss my people, my girlfriend, just my live was there. Berkeley can be tough, but it’s the kind of chaos that keeps you alive — like, you complain about it constantly, but secretly love it.

Can’t wait to come back and start struggling again lol.

If you’re there right now, really, appreciate it. The little things, the late nights, the random laughs, the walks across campus when the air feels just right. You’ll miss them more than you think",berkeley

UC Transfer Struggling with Degree Reqs,New-Bandicoot4666,1760463647,5,0,/r/berkeley/comments/1o6m91d/uc_transfer_struggling_with_degree_reqs/,,,"Hi everyone!

  
I just transferred from UC Riverside as a double major in English and Education. I know the majority of transfers here are from CC, so it makes sense that there isn't a lot of information for transfer credit counting towards degree class reqs for UC or other 4 year institution transfers. But currently, I was told by an Education advisor that the education courses that I took at UCR probably wouldn't count towards my major reqs here. I'm just a bit confused as to why they can't count, or if anyone else has encountered something similar? I'm double majoring, which already means I have a bit more course load to juggle, but now I've been told that it's possible I'll have to start my education degree from scratch. Has anyone else been through a similar issue, and if so, what did you do to fix it? 

  
I'm also just frustrated with this entire thing because I spent the majority of my 2 years at UCR trying to finish my general eds. 1: because I was told it's probably best to do so if I wanted to transfer (though that may be outdated info at this point), and 2: UCR seems to emphasize a lot more on general eds than Berkeley, because we had to complete about 17 courses for our general eds whereas here we only need to do 7. So now I'm stuck with all these general eds that I don't even know can count towards my graduation reqs, and a bunch of incomplete major classes that counted at UCR but don't count here. 

  
Does anyone know what I can do to fix this situation? I've already submitted some of the syllabi of my education courses back at Riverside to my advisory, hoping they can count them towards my major at this point. ",berkeley

But this weekend I went to go visit him, which we don’t do often because it’s easier and cheaper for him to come to me. Either way, I told him weeks in advance that I had a midterm that week and that I would NEED to spend that weekend studying. I explained that this class has 2 exams that makeup the grade and nothing else, so this was obviously really important. My typical midterm study schedule, the one I’ve used for my midterms the past two weeks have been: rest day Friday, 6 hrs sat, 6 hrs sun, 6 hrs Monday (AT LEAST). ^(don’t have class M, F). I try my best to develop a job-like routine because I’m taking 21 units (16 Berkeley, 5 CC). Now, I’m a double major in economics and legal studies (working towards CPA hence CC), and he is a business of film major. I do understand that we don’t do the same things exactly so like I can’t expect him to understand what it is EXACTLY that I do. BUT I feel like this weekend I studied maybe 6ish hours  (Non-Consecutive) and he 
wanted to leave for half of them. Like he was so appalled at the idea of staying at the library all day - something he claims he has never done. (Even though I said that’s what I needed to do). I really do always bag on him about how USC is a joke and how like we have so many Nobel Prizes, the academic rigor, etc.  I’ve always felt that we functioned in two different worlds academically because BERKELEY IS FUCKING HARD AND YOU NEED TO STUDY HARD AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL. Guess a part of me just wonders if it is the difference in our majors or the difference in our schools.

I transferred from a very small liberal arts &amp; comms school on the east coast which i loved but was stupid expensive, yet I was so much happier and way more motivated to be an A+ student and involved with orgs and stuff there because of the happiness.

Where do Berkeley students usually hear about fun campus challenges or new apps?,Soft_Boysenberry4692,1760292483,2,0,/r/berkeley/comments/1o4w60v/where_do_berkeley_students_usually_hear_about_fun/,,,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m part of a small Bay-Area-based startup, and we’re launching something fun specifically for Berkeley students — kind of a “live better” challenge with some real money prizes.

Before we announce anything, I’m trying to figure out where students actually notice things these days. 

Like…
1. Are most students still reading Facebook groups?
2. Or is it mostly Discord servers, club group chats, or campus newsletters?
3. Do you check Reddit for stuff like that, or mostly see it through friends / orgs / Insta stories?

If you’re a current student (or recent alum), we’d love to hear what channels you actually notice or trust on campus. 🙏

Thanks in advance — and if anyone’s curious about the challenge idea, happy to share more once we figure out the right channels to post it.",berkeley

Important information:

\- There are courses and training opportunities for ALL skill levels and levels of commitment. Interested in competing? We got you. Just want to goof off with some friends in a more exciting playground? We're there. Want to humble some egos, maybe even your own? Go for it! Need to get some zoomies out in a new, extremely discounted, and awesome environment? Sign up!

\- The gym gets updated pretty frequently which different courses/obstacles being altered or replaced in some way, so it will probably be a little different every time that you come :) You can also make your own course that staff can time you in (to compete with friends or just to see how fast you are), or the staff can make one for you!

\- We do NOT have a schedule set up yet, and are making it based on YOUR schedule, so please use the link in the general-info channel to let us know when you are available!

\- Officers have not been chosen yet, so if you are even a little interested, let us know! 

\- We \*WILL\* be getting epic discounts on the gym, less than $15 but actual numbers are still up in the air.

\- If you really like the gym, you can get more private lessons! While they are not advertised as one-on-one, they are extremely intimate because this gym is not super popular, so you might get a one-on-one class

\- Because this gym is not extremely popular (it's just a pretty niche thing, there is nothing wrong with the gym at ALL. A handful of clubs at Cal went to check it out last Friday and it was INCREDIBLE), it is usually pretty empty too!

\- The gym is in Richmond, so there is a commute necessary, but it is not very long. Here is the gym if you want to check it out: [Home | Traverse Fitness](https://www.traversefit.com/)

Berkeley CS grads blacklisted due to cheating on interviews,sojojo,1760210943,50,0,/r/berkeley/comments/1o44h61/berkeley_cs_grads_blacklisted_due_to_cheating_on/,,,"Let me preface this by saying that this is not a rigorous study, but an anecdote from an experienced tech worker at an SV start up that is growing rapidly and primarily employs software engineers. I did not attend Berkeley but always admired and generally get along with my coworkers who did. I've been a guest at your campus many times.

My company has been in hiring mode for the past few months and conducts multiple interviews every day. As with many VC-backed start ups, we prioritize interviewing engineers from big tech companies and graduates from top schools, which includes Berkeley. 

It should surprise no one that unauthorized AI and LLM usage is a growing problem in many areas, including hiring. It's especially problematic because it's often not possible to say that someone's answer definitively was not their own, even if it's strongly suspected during early interview rounds. That's all to say that there is a degree of uncertainty until a candidate comes on site and can be tested in a controlled environment.

I lead a team adjacent to the engineering org and speak with their hiring managers and interviewers frequently about process and hiring status. Lately, nearly every interviewer I've spoken to has said the same thing: cheating is rampant, and Berkeley grads are the worst offenders.

I'm posting this here because I still have a lot of respect for your unviersity and hope that this trend can be turned around. Cheating doesn't only affect the person doing it, but reflects badly on your school and can impact your classmates'/alumni job prospects as well. We probably won't consider new grads from Berkeley for a while, at least in engineering, as a result. And that is a shame.",berkeley

Meeting People is Hard / Falsely Advertised,CorgiLordi,1761644411,6,29,/r/UCDavis/comments/1oi4xlg/meeting_people_is_hard_falsely_advertised/,,,"hi, i don't mean to join the sea of posts complaining about this specific topic but coming in as a transfer student seems absolutely miserable. my biggest fear going to a big college was that it'd be just like community college where i didn't really get to know too many people until i was like, already moving. for context i have had one friend group that started in middle school and has stuck together through online outlets like discord and instagram. i love those people dearly, they're the life in my veins that pushes me to keep going. but i would like to meet new people.

my orientation went great and i loved hanging out with the people there, but we didn't stick as well as i'd hoped and i've barely talked to any of them since. my next bet was to talk to people from my classes, which i did to some extent. however, they became more like work acquaintances than real frends. so, naturally, i went to clubs, namely the guitar club since i have been interested in learning guitar. when i went, though, i was surrounded by pre-established friend groups of 2-4 people who had been going already. outside of the icebreaker i never opened my mouth there. maybe that's my fault for not going out of my way to talk to people, i don't know. seeing as that wasn't working, i stopped going.

this is all happening while i live in a double with my roommate, who seemed to get along with the other people in our building just fine, though all my efforts to get close with them were fruitless. i feel isolated in my own home of all places.

it just felt like every time one of my efforts failed, i'd try something else, only to be shot down again. the last time i tried to talk to someone, it was in the memorial union outside the little snack spot they have there. i got myself some crappy gummies and ate on one of the tables nearby. sitting in the table in front of me was someone with a bag of spicy doritos, interestingly they folded the bag up when they were done. i thought that was really funny for some reason so i wanted to ask why they did it. but they were just on their phone for a long ass time. i ended up leaving, ashamed i never talked to them due to shyness... i turned my head to see what they were doing on their phone, and lo and behold do i see the iphone control panel. i guess maybe i was making them uncomfortable, and they were using their phone because they didn't want to talk to me.

then i just had a mental break. not like a violent, crying one, but just a silent rage type of one. i went on amazon and ordered an electric guitar and amp. if i'm not spending my time socializing, then i'll just embrace being isolated and fuck off to practice elsewhere.

what's shocking to me is all my life, people have been telling me ""you'll meet your people in college."" so where are they? i'm here and i've never felt lonelier in my entire life. just really feels falsely advertised, lol.

someone made a post a couple days ago about how all the days seem blurred together. i feel like i couldn't relate more. every day just feels like i'm going through the motions because i have to, but the force that makes my legs move gets weaker by the day. i've never wondered ""what's the point?"" as much as i have now. it helps to know i'm not the only one at least

i'm not really making this post for advice on what to do, rather i just want to evoke a similar feeling as the other person's post did; you are not alone. i'll get this damn degree even if i have to do it out of spite and through an isolated struggle. i don't care, i just need to get out of here as fast as possible.",UCDavis

Looking for ways to meet smart and thoughtful people in Davis,SuperbSand22,1761414648,4,0,/r/UCDavis/comments/1ofxxd4/looking_for_ways_to_meet_smart_and_thoughtful/,,,"I graduated two years ago and have found it difficult to make close friends in Davis. I've been putting myself out there and met some cool people, but haven't found someone who I click with on a deeper level.

I am looking for people who are thoughtful, smart, left-brained, and broadly curious. I get that small talk has its place, but I want people who appreciate deeper conversations. I find it hard to find people like this. I'm not claiming that I'm incredibly smart, but I love talking to highly intelligent people. Personality-wise, I can be funny, playful, and outgoing once comfortable, but like a lot of nerds, I can seem a bit dorky, shy, and initially awkward which can be a barrier to forming friends.

If you know of good places, clubs, or volunteer organizations around Davis where it’s easier to meet kind and smart people, I’d love some suggestions. Ideally, I would be able to meet people who have at least some shared interests like gardening, writing, hiking, and the like.

My kid is planning a transfer for Fall 2026 and checking ASSIST for 2025-2026. For a bunch of UC Davis majors, it looks like almost no lower-division prep is listed. Engineering looks the most wild. Last year there were clear series listed. Now it feels like almost nothing is required.



Is anyone else seeing this?



Key questions:



* Are the 2025-2026 UC Davis agreements final, or still being updated?
* If they are not final, when does ASSIST usually get fully updated each year?
* For planning right now, should we follow 2024-2025, the UC Davis catalog, UC Transfer Pathways, or College of Engineering advising pages?
* Any official note from UCD or ASSIST about this change or a delay?
* If you already talked to a UC Davis advisor, what did they say about using last year’s agreements vs the new ones?

Excess unit petition for switching majors,elonIsRuiningX,1761342183,1,3,/r/UCDavis/comments/1ofabzp/excess_unit_petition_for_switching_majors/,,,"Currently a 3rd year CSE major trying to switch into a double major in EE and CE with a CS minor. I submitted my change of major petition a week ago after attending the change of major workshop. This week, one of the ECE advisors reached out to me asking me to submit an excess unit petition since I've reached 140.5 units (13.5 of them were from community college classes I took) and anyone who wants to switch majors after hitting 135 units needs to submit that petition and the way the advisors were talking about it made it seem like there was a chance it could get denied.

I already filled out the petition and sent it back to the advisors. I followed up and asked more about it and they were saying that I would probably have to wait until December before I can fully switch my major because that's when the UGEP committee meets. What can I do to make sure that this petition gets approved? Because I heard if it gets denied then that would mean I can't switch majors and there's nothing I can do. All of the classes I have taken so far would count towards the EE/CE double major or the CS minor and I have close to a 4.0 GPA. I just went 5 units over that 135 unit threshold. 

I know I might be worrying too much but I really don't want to continue with CSE and I really want to do stuff with hardware and electronics. I've heard that most of those petitions get approved especially because college of engineering doesn't have the unit cap but I'm genuinely kind of worried about what I'm going to do if it gets denied.",UCDavis

TLDR: 
1. Threatened to kick us out because we said no pre-moveout carpet inspection, even though it is agreed on paper previously and signed by me, my roommates, and the leasing office. Picture attached in this review.
2. Charged us almost $2400 after we move out for “wear and tear” in addition to $1100 deposit
3. We paid rent + utility timely the first day of EVERY month, still charged $550 extra after move out cuz “we did not pay for utility for the last 3 months of stay”.
4. Some people in management team are very passive aggressive during communication. 

Attached pics: 
1. Letter to kick us out if we don’t give permission for inspection 
2. Original repair invoice after we move out 
3. Corrected repair invoice 

Here’s the longer story if you wanna kill some time 

1. Me and 2 other friends lived here 9/23-9/25. 6 months before we moved out, we signed a document with the leasing office, saying we do not want any pre-moveout inspection because all of us will be gone during summer and will not have time to clean up before the pre-moveout inspection. In 7/25, which is 1.5 months before our official move out date, we received a notice stocked on our door saying the leasing office will do pre-move out carpet inspection in 3 days. Mind you non of us were in Davis, the only way we found out about this is because my partner was grabbing some stuff from my room and saw the notice. We argued with the manager, Kyra, who said the leasing office had every right to enter our apartment since they put out the notice 72 hrs in advance. The next day, fulling aware none of us were in Davis, she put another notice on our door, threatened to kick us out if we do not give permission for the inspection. We reminded them multiple times that we already signed a document 6 months prior saying we do not want any inspection. Eventually they gave in. 

2. After move out, they charged us $2400 extra outside of $1100 deposit. The carpet and vinyl were already 9 years old, which is approaching the use limit (they change all the carpet and vinyl every 10 years). Despite approaching use time limit, they charged us FULL AMOUNT for vinyl replacement. We argued with leasing office for almost a month before they got back to us and correct the invoice. 

3. Charged us $550 extra for the last 3 months of utility before we move out because “we did not pay”. However, we paid rent and utility timely on the first day of every month. After showing them screenshots, they still deny the mistake. Called them, I was on the phone for 30 minutes with a guy, explaining that we were charged extra and they need to fix the invoice, but the person didn’t know what’s going on and was trying to convince me that we did not pay. 

4. The whole process of communicating with the team back and forth was EXTREMELY frustrating because they will not admit their mistakes. After arguing with them a whole months, they finally agreed to correct the invoice and gave our deposit back. I cannot imagine how many tenants they have charged extra after moveout and how much money they made off people who do not have the habit of arguing with the leasing office. ",UCDavis

right off the bat I was a little devastated on the first day of move-in. I was sobbing on the floor of my dorm because the bare walls were making me nauseous. I had a hard time letting go of my parents. they kept telling me id do great and they're so proud of me. the last thing i wanted was to drop my arms from them and feel theirs drop from me and watch them drive away. trying to recall the first few days seems so strange and unfamiliar, like that was never actually a part of my timeline. Just events in my head that dont make any sense at all. 

one of the first people who tried to talk to me was a drunk guy who followed me home from a party. party itself was extremely dull. i saw people around me having a good time. i was trying to have a good time too but it felt impossible. dude saw me standing by myself and told me he was going to leave with me. it was entertaining until i couldn't go back to my dorm because he was so set on coming back with me. i watched him puke on the sidewalk like 4 times before i finally convinced him to text his roommate to come pick him up.

orientation was so bleak as well. i tried talking to people but it seems like i just wasn't what they were looking for. they were more interested in each other.

since classes have started everything has just felt the same. i still dont have the stupid roads memorized here because everything feels chaotic and pointless. i sometimes go a whole day without opening my mouth because i dont have anyone to talk to. the past few weeks have blended into a single memory of giant ceiling lights and back pain and the image of the back of everyones heads. i dont know what to do next. i wish i could take a nap that was heavy enough to fix all of this.",UCDavis

I went to the old version lots of times, before the UMall closed in 2023.

When I got there, I didn't see the Beef Bowl combo ($14.95) they had on their online order website. There was an $18.99 version though. I decided to go for the $12.99 crispy chicken combo instead. I picked medium spiciness, out of mild-medium-hot. 

The chicken came out first, a few minutes before the tea. Some notes:

*  It was unseasoned. Not just un-spicy, unseasoned (not even salt), like they forgot to season it. I checked my receipt, it said ""medium"", so it couldn't have been an ordering error. There didn't seem to be any ""add your own seasoning"" station either, so it wasn't that.
* It was not hot, only somewhat warm. 
* It was a bit soggy.
* Came in a paper bag, not a box. (I'm guessing because they just opened, no boxes yet?)

The chicken was definitely a far cry from what it used to be, or what iTea/Raretea/anyplace else offer.  I guess it had been sitting a while. Especially since it had no seasoning, not good.

Then the tea came. I got the House Boba Milk Tea, not bad! Notes:

* Good strong tea flavor, similar to what I remember.
* Nice tall size.
* Good boba texture.
* I ordered 25% sweetness - perfect. Not too sweet.

Other general notes

* Nice staff! Clean place. I like the flowers.
* The music was uncomfortably loud.
* No kiosk ordering
* Only a few tables inside. The old place was kinda like this, but even fewer.

Overall, I'm not planning to go back for a while. I know it will get better as they get back into their groove.",UCDavis

One of my last remaining degree requirements is an upper division stats class. I am an environmental science major who hasn't taken stats since community college about 5 years ago, so I'm looking for something that won't kick my ass too hard. I wish I could take STA 101 since it seems the most relevant, but it's not offered winter quarter and that's when I'll have the most schedule space. Does anyone have any recs? Here is the list.

Perfect, less strain on my family, perfect. 
Now I wake up, and it's saying $2,000 PLUS by November 15. Who can pay that? Can you imagine ? 
My friend suffered a medical emergency last year, intense vertigo and hospitalized right before finals. She took an incomplete and now she faces financial aid cuts and medical bills I don't understand. She's talking about dropping out and going to CSU. I don't know what to think anymore. 
Why doesn't this university help people? How can anyone drop a charge like that on someone and just expect them to find it in their email? I feel crushed. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. My mom is all I got, and we can't afford this. Not this year. She's working hard to pay off a lawyer. I was so happy when I showed her my $88 dollars a month. Felt like I did my part. 
How can they do that, tempt someone into thinking they earned a four year degree, that life outside the forgetten parts of LA is at all possible? Kicked in the teeth by a boot, that's what this feels like.

and then your friends can reply to the thought bubble and say if they're down to join you for that activity. so all of your friends can have their own thought bubbles and you can reply to them too to join them. it's like a no pressure way of asking any of your friends if you want to do something together, because you're going to do it anyway if no one joins you but it gently allows people to join you on mundane things if they happen to be nearby and available for that time. 

its different from asking someone directly cause you aren't like arranging an official ""meeting"" or ""appointment"" time with anybody and its like a more casual version of When2Meet. and its a little more spontaneous instead of planned if u happen to find the time to join somebody on an adventure. this is useful for university students who live pretty close to each other generally and want to go on random side quests with their friends

maybe only issue is that it would have to be mainstream enough like instagram for all your friends to join, i just kind of wish this existed. or maybe instagrams development team should hire me lol. but idk is this just something we should use instagram notes for?? but i feel like when u post a instagram note people won't take it as seriously and it doesn't really look  like u are asking anyone to join u specifically. what do u think??",UCDavis

This, in turn, is driving dialog around opportunities to:

* improve the development of research software, and
* incentivize useful sharing, curation, and ongoing maintenance of research software artifacts and related knowledge.

Of course, research software does not develop, curate, or maintain itself. Accordingly, widespread research software growth has included emerging roles for people who create, maintain, and contribute to the research software ecosystem. These roles can bring value directly through enabling specific research projects. They also bring value indirectly, through helping ensure enduring impact of research software innovations and by facilitating adequate reproducibility standards in digital science.

Our group is looking for students that either want to become a research software engineer or want to improve their software development skills.

We have activities for students that are able to commit large or small amounts of time.

He had it parked in the bike parking lot between 5019 and 5017, right in front of the door to 5017 and a security camera. He had an orange Kryptonite U-Lock securely attached to the frame and bike parking.

We came out around 8am to go shopping, only to find his U-Lock on the ground sawed in half. Then, a man (shout out Kendrick) came up asking if we had lost a bike. He proceeded to tell us that around 4am he heard an angle grinder and an awful smell coming from the bike parking lot. Then he took this video about an hour later, and  confronted the guy trying to load the bike into his truck. He said he was able to wrestle the bike away from the guy, scare him off, and turn it into the police. This dude was an actual saint, thank you kind stranger. 

  
We're still waiting on any possible security camera footage, but not particularly hopeful on the thief being identified by the police. 

Just wanted to share for anyone who also parks in the area.

for example my mat 21c class is so fast pace and the concepts we’re learning is actually some i already know but it’s so fast i can barely take notes and understand at the same time. so when doing hw im literally teaching myself but i dont fully get the concepts in the way i fully should

 in both these classes i end up just referencing the slides cuz my notes are useless but idk i just don’t get how when i get to class i try to follow a long, i make an effort, i do the hw and nothing sticks

Pet PSA,Sterling_Boirelle,1760840917,12,212,/r/UCDavis/comments/1oaebhe/pet_psa/,,,"Pets are a **long-term commitment.** They cost money, get sick, make messes, and grow from cute babies into full-grown animals with needs, personalities, and quirks. Some of them will live **20 years or more.**

If you buy or adopt an animal without the ability or desire to care for it long-term,  you are a **piece of shit.** Try not to be one of these morons you will find here from time to time posting about how after a lot of hard thought they now **URGENTLY** need someone to take their pet or pets in for them inexplicably as they either graduate or move on short notice.

We posted about this before, but we are in URGENT need of finding homes for these cuties! If you can rehome them, please help us sharing this information!! 

With a lot of pain in my heart, I'm posting because I need to rehome my 3 chinchillas. I'm a grad student, I need to move out of my place, and it would be irresponsible to keep the chinchillas with me, probably without being able to provide the care they need. And as I love them so much, I want to give them the chance to find a home that can provide the care they deserve. Of course, if people need the enclosures and all their supplies and toys, they can take them.

The dad was rescued from a really abusive house, and his two kids were born on Feb of 2024. Unfortunately, their mom passed away when they were only a few days old and we bottle fed them until they were happy and healthy. The two boys live in an enclosure (dad and son), and the girl lives in her own enclosure:

\-Pierre Jean-Jacques (1st picture): The dad. He can be grumpy, and he can try to soft bite you if the reason of interaction is anything different than food. But he is the greatest dad ever and after the baby's mom died, he would protect them, groom them, and caress them. And in a good day, he can get some pets in between running sessions (oh! he loves to run, run and run... in their wheel). Note: Pierre was seriously neglected, he got cataracts, and he missed a couple of toes. Nonetheless, last time the vet checked him (at UC Davis Small Animals clinic) they said Pierre was healthy. They believe he is 8+ year old. When I rescued him, he would not let anyone approach the cage, he used to bite everyone and used to pee all over the walls. We made a huge progress, and with his son, he has seemed a lot more active and open to humans.

\-Luigi Salvatore (aka. Lou-Lou, Lou) (2nd picture): Lou is sweetheart. He loves food and he loves pets. He is by far the biggest (same size as his mom). He likes to run and likes to jump around the different levels of his enclosure, but at a moderate level of energy. Eventually he runs in the wheel, but his favorite activity (other than napping) is to chew apple sticks!

\-Delilah Agatha (aka. Dee, Dee-dee, Dee-dee the dasher) (3rd picture): She is a whole different story, she loves humans paying attention to her and she loves pets and play time. She loves cleaning time, and she will try to take everything you're using around her cage. She jumps from one level to the other in a second and you're not paying attention; she will try to make a run through the door.

They are located in Sacramento, CA and I work in Davis, CA. Again, this is really a hard decision to take but we want to give them the chance to find the best home possible and avoid jeopardizing their wellbeing. Let me know if you have any questions!",UCDavis

The club idea is to gather in a park or public place, and we will take turns holding still/modeling for \~five minute and draw each other, so that we can all practice portrait/figure drawing from life! No skill level required. The focus of the group is to provide an opportunity to practice drawing humans without paying for an actual figure drawing class ;) so the primary rule of participating is you do have to take your turn posing for at least a few minutes, but your pose is up to you and can be simple as sitting in your chair. Everyone should feel comfortable; that is the second rule of the club, to keep a chill vibe and respect boundaries.

Alternatively, if you don't want to draw but you'd like to come help and model for us and have some art made of yourself, please come too! You can read a book, meditate, do your own craft, or just plain hang out.

If this sounds interesting to you at all, please comment/message me! I will rope you in the next time I manage to gather my tiny group of drawing friends, or we can plan our own date if there are enough of us.

Why didn’t I move? I thought this student was covering their mouth / wearing a mask cause in my mind…why on earth would they not? However, I looked back and realized neither was the case, and at that point it was too late for me 💔

I’m missing classes that count participation points. But luckily they all give at least two excused absences. What I don’t get is why students choose to go to class sick instead of taking advantage of the excused absences. The classes I’m in don’t even have midterms for another two weeks and lectures are recorded, so really there’s no reason for you to be in class. 

In short: Please wear a mask or better yet, don’t come to class if you’re sick. Leave the room if you’re having a coughing fit. 

Anyways, that’s my rant. 

May none of you catch a cold. Stay healthy everyone. ",UCDavis

It collects a rich set of data about travel to the UC Davis campus, demographics, and attitudes toward different modes of travel covering commute habits, bicycle theft, and bike crashes/collisions.

If you've taken the survey in the past, you're probably aware that it could take up to 20 minutes to complete (ya, it was intense). However, after years of slimming down and streamlining, you should be able to knock this survey out in less than 10 minutes.

&gt;Every ten years, the City of Davis in coordination with Unitrans undergoes a Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP) which looks at Unitrans bus service and provides proposals and recommendations on service improvements. The SRTP process began in 2024 with extensive outreach to Unitrans passengers in Fall 2024 on their thoughts and opinions on current service and future service. Based on ridership trends, growth patterns, and your feedback, the planning process has route and service hour proposals available for review and feedback. Once the SRTP is complete, Unitrans (UC Davis) and the City of Davis **may use the findings and recommendations for future bus routes, service modifications, schedule changes, fleet purchases, fares, transfer locations, operating expenses, revenue projections, and other initiatives.**

  
Want to talk to City and Unitrans staff and provide input in person? Find them here:

And I see this dude walking towards my direction where I was sitting I didn't think much of it because it's normal for people to walk here and there in the library. However, I see that he starts to tie his shoe and eventually he sits on the floor in front of my desk in between me and this other girl while the other desks were completely empty. I didn't think much of it since I was trying to do my biology lab. Eventually I look down and I see that his hand is extremely close to my foot, I was wearing sandals (luckily with socks on) I didn't think much of it since people do lean on their hands when they sit on the ground. However he kept doing this and getting to close to my foot at which point he gets so close that I'm literally stepping on his fingers with my sandal even after that he still doesn't remove his hand under my sandal until I move my feet away. I also noticed that he was using the reflection of his phone to look at my crotch area. He was tilting his phone in a way where he could see my crotch area. I eventually get up and confront him saying if he needs anything and he says no. His excuse was that he had a condition where his knees lock and it's painful for him so he has to sit on the ground but that didn't even make sense since he didn't leave until I told him too. If he was feeling better why didn't he leave earlier. After he does leave, I go down to the first floor at the main desk and tell them what happened. Eventually the police gets involved and I tell the police officer what happened and currently right now they are in process of writing a report about this fucking weirdo. Also the girl that was at the desk in front of me also told me how this guy had done this to her, she even took pictures of him once again on the ground.

Last year we were just finishing up 8 straight days of 100F+ temperatures and set the record for average high for October (87.8F). This year, we have only hit that temperature once this month.

October is always the funky month where Davis is trying to figure out what its weather should be. Sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's rain, sometimes it's both and we get wild thunderstorms. This year overall has been cooler/different than the previous record-setting year, and dang we need that.

Transfer student wanting to switch into engineering?,Basic-Crew-2560,1760296131,1,3,/r/UCDavis/comments/1o4xqwe/transfer_student_wanting_to_switch_into/,,,"Hello,

I came into UC Davis as a Math major but over the summer, I took a coding class which made me realize that I honestly have a passion for coding as I have taken up learning other programming languages since then. I want to transfer my major to computer science engineering since I am also taking a physics course and I like it so far but I was told by advising that transfers with over 135 units are not guaranteed to have their major switch approved into the college of engineering, even if they meet all the prerequisites. 

So my question: Are there any other transfer students who have decided to switch their majors into engineering, and if so, how did it work out? Because tbh, Im even considering reapplying to other CSUs and UCs once again...",UCDavis

A win will put either team firmly in the driver's seat for an FCS Playoff bid and the Big Sky conference race, while a loss here would cause some serious regrouping in order to still have a chance of getting to the ""safe zone"" of 8 wins.

.

  
**Game Overview**

NAU has had a somewhat similar path to Davis this season, with wins over two of the same opponents. However, unlike the Ags, NAU has had something approaching a respectable win so far in Incarnate Word, and came away with a not-terrible score when losing to a very good Arizona State team. UCD meanwhile is still hunting for a genuine quality win, and we could arguably get one this afternoon.

The big story ont he personnel side is that the conference's best defensive player, Rex Connors, is out for the season for Davis, and potentially his brother Porter as well. However, defensive additions like Jacob Psyk have stepped up in a big way in terms of putting pressure and forcing turnovers. The Ags likely won't be able to stop NAU outright, but have a good chance of slowing them down, keeping them off-kilter, and keeping the score manageable. On the offensive side of the ball, the Ags will want to establish a ground game to control possession and clock, which should be doable since RB duo Jordan Fisher and Carter Vargas have been incredible this year and backstopped by QB Caden Pinnick's running ability.

Readmission & Change of Major,nailong4evr,1760054368,3,16,/r/UCDavis/comments/1o2lxsv/readmission_change_of_major/,,,"Hello! I'm a withdrawn student in bad academic standing, I left Davis back in 2019 and am looking to be readmitted and change my major into psychology. 

I've sorted out a lot of the reasons why I was struggling in my time at UC Davis and discovered my passion for psych! I'm hoping I can be readmitted into the psychology major - I'm currently in the college of engineering. 

  
I'm curious if anyone can shed some light for me if they've been in a similar situation. I have completed a lot of credits already because I withdrew beginning of my senior year. I have around 145 credits. I'm hoping I can still change my major to psych even after completing this amount of credits. Does anyone have any idea of what an advisor would say about my situation? 

I'm actively trying to set up an advising appointment with the psychology department. Currently have an appointment with the engineering college!

Plus a lot of old men and high schoolers who don't even go to Ucla go here. 

LA Fitness Westwood: this gym is dirty and lowkey has unhoused people in the showers all the time, most who mind their own but some who do weird things. Often times you'll see gym bros trying to act tough and pick fights over nothing. The MILFs are hot here but they all don't want to be here so it's not a place to even make any eye contact. It has a lot of young professionals going. The entrance is a bitch, you gotta show the world you are entering and leaving in heavy traffic. 

Wooden Gym: where I go proudly dick-in-hand. Sometimes I hear the guys singing in the shower, including yours truly. The sauna is dirty AF and we can't share it with the ladies because they think it causes sex to happen. If anything, I need a private sauna just for me so prevent temptation from others reaching me. The equipment is dirty. Like fucking..two people at the front desk and a huge gym. Frat boys hog the equipment. Some juice heads on roids go often. Mornings are the best time to go to avoid crowds ans staff members who like to use their lunch time there. Not a great gym but it's here. 


Kinross rec center: I got admitted by flirting with a former TA who helped me sneak in. It's just a glorified bungalow! It's clean and without frat boys. It's alright but I've had better. ",ucla

The practice exam on canvas was so easy but covered all content and wasn't worded like shit so everyone went in the exam hoping for the best. God was that the greatest edge he could have done. Instead, it is like he went into Chat GPT and told him ""generate me some questions"" and then when GPT gave him half decent questions and decent answer choices he then said ""make it so that only the illiterate can somehow piece together wtf I am asking."" You can not make this shit up, everyone I asked from the dumb as bricks to smart asf all said the same thing: ""wtf was that shit"".

"Electronic Torture and ""Gangstalking""",Time-Internal6823,1761676476,4,0,/r/ucla/comments/1oihhjg/electronic_torture_and_gangstalking/,,,"In our modern age, technology exists that can control human physiological functions and even emotions. Behaviors and reactions to these new technologies may have been tested on you without your consent.

I cannot fully comprehend and put into words of what happened to me. Ever since my senior year of 2023, I suspected that I have been a target of [electronic torture](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/InterimCommittee/ReL/Document/27234). It became difficult for me to tell reality from the preconceived experiences I thought. My perspective began to change as I became paranoid, thinking that even friends or family are involved. I cannot claim any organization that may have been doing this because I have no concrete evidence. Based on how pervasive and widespread it is, I can assume that it operates as a unit, each with roles in altering my reality. 

I do not know the purpose, but I began to hypothesize that it may have been a government conducted experiment to test [direct energy weapons](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-believe-us-embassy-staff-and-cia-officers-were-hit-with-high-power-microwaves-heres-how-the-weapons-work/#:~:text=Havana%20syndrome%20is%20likely%20linked,the%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense). Then, I began researching about previous experiments done and concealed by CIA due to being unethical (MKUltra). Although I have no evidence of this, I am highly suspicious. 

Not intending to fear-monger, government agencies may have been conducting [experiment](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/dnsa-intelligence/2024-12-23/cia-behavior-control-experiments-focus-new-scholarly#:~:text=Under%20code%20names%20that%20included,part%20of%20a%20CIA%20test) by being a participant without you knowing this.

Until now, it feels like I am being controlled. From physiological functions to emotions with no end. It feels alienating because no one has the same experiences like this that I can talk with. I just want to know what everyone knows regarding this that can be helpful in my case other than seeking a psychiatrist help.

Overwhelmed by organic chemistry? Assignments and tests creeping up on you and feeling like you’re in hot water? Or maybe you’re doing well and need that 95%? Whatever your struggle with organic chemistry may be, I’m here to make sure you succeed. 

Why work with me? 

- Every tutor knows the subject, but not every tutor knows how to transfer that knowledge to a student. I do. 
- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it’s not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you’ll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You’ll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let’s chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we’d be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

I turned around to go the opposite direction after several minutes of being followed and he quickly punched me in the chest before continuing to walk in the direction that he was originally following me in.

2. At the Amazon pickup lockers, a 20-30 year old black man wearing a ski mask started yelling at me for turning around and making eye contact with him after I spoke with an employee. I ignored him and he proceeded to yell death threats at me for like 5 minutes, during which one lady speed walked out the store and the other two bystanders just stood and watched.

ms or a direct phd after undergraduate?,90calibrenet,1761626777,5,3,/r/ucla/comments/1oi0kh2/ms_or_a_direct_phd_after_undergraduate/,,,"hi, i'm applying to ucla for graduate school for computer science starting fall 2026. i'm in my final year of undergraduate from a non-us university. i've completed two summer research internships from top research/academic institutes in my country, one of them led to a conference paper. i have also completed independent projects and am in the process of communicating one of them to a conference as well, but it probably won't be done until well after the application deadline for most grad schools. one of my eventual goals is to get into a phd, but i am anxious that i don't have enough research experience or depth in a particular technical area to be prepared enough for a phd just yet. i know the phd program has coursework that will get me the knowledge i need for whatever fields i want to work on, but for that i need to get into the phd program before anything else.

so i wanted to ask, is it better for me to apply to the ms program at ucla and then continue to a phd (preferably at ucla if i find a research topic i love and an advisor)? in that case, how rigorous is the process of immediately starting a phd at ucla after my ms? or should i directly apply to the ucla phd program despite not having enough specialised research experience/technical depth?

any advice into this would be really appreciated!",ucla
Do you think college application fees hold some students back from applying?,Boring_Distance_7320,1761624724,3,0,/r/ucla/comments/1ohzzdb/do_you_think_college_application_fees_hold_some/,,,"One of my intrusive thoughts lately

With deadlines coming up, I’ve been thinking about how much application fees add up — $60 here, $75 there — and it really starts to impact which schools students feel comfortable applying to.

Do you think fees actually hold students back from applying to certain colleges?

I also found out it has soy protein isolate and I won't eat it anymore because it can grow tits! The bastard didn't even say thanks, he just took it like an entitlement. I gave him the finger afterwards. I think a TA noticed it from the front and that's why he was glaring at me before class started. 

I wish our classes were arranged in a roundtable discussion format. At the nursing home, I catch everyone playing cards at the table and everybody takes a turn telling me their wild sex stories and giving advice. I tell them who I'm either pushing away off of me or who trying to date.

Allowing myself to not be ok,AdExisting4997,1761621447,0,13,/r/ucla/comments/1ohyylh/allowing_myself_to_not_be_ok/,,,"It’s freeing to admit that I wasn’t mentally stable through undergrad. 

Recent grad here, c/o 2025, I was really hard on myself the last four years. I dealt with a lot of social anxiety and stuck with friends who treated me as more of an afterthought. I also made the choice to stay in those taxing relationships and not branch out. It was not like me to advocate for myself or make an effort to feel seen. I went through undergrad passively; I didn’t speak up in class, go to office hours unless I had to, and got my letters of recommendation from my boss and coworkers. I didn’t have close friends, and I really struggled to be vulnerable with them, especially with me being so dismissive of my internal struggles. I’m starting therapy again. I’m a month and a half into my master's program. I also just got out of an off-again, on-again relationship that was more of a wake-up call. While I don’t regret sharing those memories with him, I realized how much I missed out on experiencing UCLA and being an undergrad because I was so concerned with “losing” him. Coming from a traumatic household and into adulthood, I would date as a coping mechanism and get attached way too fast. I set myself up for heartbreak and subconsciously expected to find someone to fix me. It wasn’t fair to the guys I would date, and it was so damaging to me and my energy. I realized how bad it was when I broke down sobbing, and dry heaving cuz of-again on-again guy said he wasn’t ready for a relationship. he said I didn’t deserve him hurting me, and told me he was going through it, and I’m grateful for the closure. I was really heartbroken and upset, and I burned the bridge, which isn’t like me. But if he comes back again, I know myself well enough that I’ll cave and cycle through the heartbreak, only to make it worse. I don’t have an action plan; I’m just naming these behaviors and feelings to “tame” them. I have such a bad habit of making my life and everything seem fine and like I’m so happily unaffected, it’s off-putting to the people I care about and draining and cyclical on my end. I’m just going to be staying off dating apps and reevaluating my relationship with myself piece by piece.",ucla

I’m doing horrible as an Econ major transfer and I don’t know what to do,greenmatchabubbletea,1761616773,8,21,/r/ucla/comments/1ohxdar/im_doing_horrible_as_an_econ_major_transfer_and_i/,,,"Hi. I transferred as an Econ major from cc this fall and I’m doing horribly. The transition to this university has been rough. First of all, I was used to having easy access to counselors and professors. But in here, everything fills up so quickly and you have to constantly fight for the attention of them. I also thought that I would get some good opportunities, mentorships, or workshops for banking or fincorp careers but I quickly realized those are under really selective clubs and those are mostly for sophomores and freshmen. So now I have to work on preparing technicals, behaviorals, and networking from scratch. 

But at the same time, Econ classes are tough and go really fast. I tried getting tutoring, but unlike my cc where it was free, you actually have to pay like 70 per hour. I still got tutoring lessons but I feel super behind and I’m scared of the Econ 11 midterm. Now, after getting distracted by a terrible roommate situation (who constantly broke the roommate agreement, would wake me up at midnight, and  constantly bring guests without my permission. So after failing to reach an agreement, I’m looking to move out), I did a really stupid mistake that costed me 15% of my Econ 105 grade and mistook the deadline time as 12 am instead of 12 pm and missed the submission, so now I have to drop the class. I also submitted a pretty mediocre essay for my elective (again because of wasting time in my roommate situation) and I don’t know how it went or if I’ll get a bad grade. Now my Econ 11 midterm is in a week and I’m scared because I don’t know if I have enough time to study.

I’m also disabled and submitted the required paperwork for CAE but still got denied from half of my accommodations. Also, it’s still hard to get help when everything gets filled up so quickly (from office hours, counseling appointments, etc).

Everything is just going terrible here for me. And I’m not sure what to do. I feel bad for not getting good results so far because I’m paying out of state tuition without aid and it’s costing my parents a lot (they live in another country so I wasn’t elegible for neither). I feel like a failure and I don’t know what to do. GPA is important for my desired career and I don’t even know if I’m going to bomb my grades if I keep going like this. I keep crying every single day here and I really don’t know what to do. I would appreciate any advice.",ucla

The job essentially consists of making Instagram reels. The system is super easy and I don't even have to show my face (takes about &lt;1min per reel created). The startup supplies the content. I just have to collate and post. 

They expect \~100 reels per week across multiple accounts. Assuming im slower than the average human, I expect to spend about 120-150 mins per week doing the internship. 

The proposed pay structure is:   
$20 per week (flat) + commission based on views and sales. 

(I'd do this for free just to learn from the founder, he's really smart and built his company from the ground up, but they're paying me for it too - bonus i guess). 

I expect the performance bonus to be very high since the reel template is proven to be working. I tried it and made a video in &lt;1min. I got 100k views. It was super easy. 

Now here's what I want to ask you guys: 

1. Should I take this free money opportunity and help a bruin out with his startup?

But I mean like, fucking...most of us have a bed space and maybe a table with chair...I made mine cozy for the longer nights and colder weather. 

With everyone getting sick easier, I don't want to expose myself (not just in a flasher way) to germs and also people might be loud. I remember some guy slamming his backpack on the table at Powell. It knocked off my study rhythm. 

I made my place cozy with some blankets, more books and a papers with pens instead of the overly simplistic setup that looked a little too sanitized. I added some details including sticky notes of my the hard things I needed to remember. I should put one in my shower at dick-level so I don't think about anything but my academics. 

I also added a heating pad despite the heater if need be but I find it difficult to avoid sleepiness unless the air is a little colder to keep me awake. 

And then, like at fucking...4am I went outside to take a breath of cold air and that really woke me up brisk one time this week when I had to wake up early to study some more. It was so quiet, anyone visiting could have taken a piss off my balcony without anyone noticing until steam arose from the garden beneath. 

Speaking of piss...there was a rush activity at the frat I was pledging before getting kicked out for bringing laxatives to a shitting contest. It was called Piss in a Bottle Dodgeball where everyone pissed a 2 liter coke bottle and then the elder members of the frat would throw the bottle with the cap open at us playing dodgeball against a wall we couldn't leave too far from.

As midterm season approaches (and our libraries begin hitting capacity), UCLA students need other places to study–which is why I built BruinSpots!

Here's the link: [https://bruin-spots.vercel.app/](https://bruin-spots.vercel.app/) (shoutout Spots by Akshar Barot for the idea)

I've scraped the UCLA schedule of classes to find when classrooms are empty (the majority of empty classrooms @ UCLA are unlocked, have AC, whiteboards, etc).

He recently asked us to rate his singing skills but we don’t want to hurt his feelings so they volunteered me to do it since I’m the nice one in the group. 

I told myself that I would try to be less hurtful and blunt but he’s a horrible singer. The last time we all went to karaoke, he tried singing Stevie Wonder-I Just Called To Say I Love You and let’s just say that I can no longer listen to that song due to his voice giving me nightmares.

All of these classes have each taken their own toll on me and definitely pushed me to my max, and it makes me wonder if this is just the common experience or if I really might not be right for this path — pre-med specifically. 

Full transparency, my grades have been consistently good (getting grades ranging from As to Bs in everything thus far), but it definitely has taken everything in me to get there. I was SO relieved that I would get a B in genchem because I genuinely thought I was cooked beyond belief. This has been a pretty consistent theme, where I am struggling, and often performing on/below average, regardless of how much studying I do. I am at powell locked in ALL the time, to the point where I feel like I am barely seeing my roommates once midterms start up.

The reason I bring this to reddit is because I genuinely can't tell if this is how everyone feels or not. When I am in groupmes, or seeing the averages, it seems like a ton of people are able to study a normal amount and do just fine — while I feel like I am doing week-long lock-ins just to make it by. Similarly, some of my other pre-med friends just seem to have an innate skill for these things. They often are able to make cross-course connections, like drawing similarities between chem and bio just based on their genuine interest and memory. When I think long-term, I wonder if I will be able to do well in the mcat or if this is the ""weeding"" happening to me in real time. 

What are your experiences? Is this imposter syndrome or are the pre-med students really just that good?

Does anyone have experience with the school demanding repayment for money they accidentally sent them?,Pizzajam124,1761112297,6,14,/r/ucla/comments/1od06se/does_anyone_have_experience_with_the_school/,,,"For context, I did the Freshman Summer program by the AAP office,  and they gave me aid for the summer.

Way back in September, I noticed a charge on my Bruin bill for an overaward, which confused me because I know I made sure I notified financial aid about any outside scholarship. I feared I made a mistake in the process, so I went to the financial aid office to confirm.

Apparently, my scholarship money was fine, but it was actually a mistake on the school's part. Basically there was a glitch in the system, and they accidentally gave me 2k as a payment for money they were supposed to give but couldn't. the system was fixed, but the money was already deposited in students' accounts so now they wanted them to pay it back.

I was upset because, 1) they didn't notify me of any of this and I had to come *to them* to know why I have a random ass charge on my account which is shady as hell 2) 2k wasn't just a drop in a bucket it was most of my money 3) this was the school's mistake, why do I have to pay for it?

But I begrudgingly paid the bill, and cursed the Aid office for having such a faulty system fucking with people's money...

Which brings us to today, I checked my bank and it said it had 2k in it, which confused me but I had money sooo

Then I called my mother, who checked my bill and said I had a charge on my account for 2k....

Lo and behold, it was the same damn summer bill I already paid off! Which means they made this mistake *twice.*

So now I'm wondering if anyone else has this problem, and what to do and if I should pay up again or call them out on their gross mishandling of my money (and sanity)",ucla

Social Events Are Abundant,Opening_Procedure449,1761053149,4,47,/r/ucla/comments/1occwkb/social_events_are_abundant/,,,"Folks, there are a lot of freshman this year who are looking for friends at this time. 

Best tips I can give are be clean, look clean, smell clean. THEN, you can go to any of the social events being held on campus. 

IDGAF if you hate pottery or sewing etc etc....just go. Go there. If you don't know how to stitch or do whatever TF activity it is that's being featured, whether it's a sport or whatever...you socialize. You talk to other people. 


Never ever reserve your outgoingness only to people who you would rather....that's not going to help you build courage needed to articulate or show confidence. 


I know each and every person who meets someone for the first few seconds either imagines having sex with them. Women tend to determine how far they'd go with you around that time. 

Don't just try and get a significant other. Aim for friends and collect them like currency. More friends can mean more social value when people hear about you and gather. But the value of friends quantity dwindled in junior year. The quality of the friendships is the true test. I'd rather have fewer but close friends than a bunch who are flaky. 


But I mean like, fucking...how do you think I met so many moms? Was it because I played my guitar near Janns Steps with my pony tail on the lawn during parents weekend (many divorcees go there)? Not really, I'd only get like fucking...2 or 3 numbers at most and call it a day walking back to my apartment nearby with my dick in my hand. It's because I do a good job of steering the ship of my study groups for class, socialize and really listen to my friends in hopes that I bring out the best in them as much as some can do for me. Meeting their moms if they visit on weekends...that's a bonus but not mandatory. Don't put everything on this giant pedestal. Live your life in an outward direction. 


Whatever it is that interests you, find others who are into what you like. If you don't know what it is, find yourself. Try to find out through new things. Don't wait for the feeling like in that Nando Fortunado song The Feeling. 

We get the experiences discovering something unexpected through trying new activities (make sure they aren't self-destructive). For me, dance really helped me. Dance like there's no tomorrow.

But like fucking...folks don't just think the school sponsored activities are for folks who aren't ""cool"". You make what's cool, not what others say....as long as you don't hurt others. 

Freshman year, I got lucky seeing a group of folks playing Who Would You Rather on a couch at my dorm lobby with a guitar player there playing dirty songs to make everyone laugh. I smiled ear to ear seeing them. But either way I didn't need them only to have a social life. There are plenty of avenues for you. Don't lose hope.

The intention of this post is to compile and explore some uncomfortable truths about UCLA culture and hope to make a less divided, more wholesome, and more understanding community. Not all of these polls were created by myself, the only ones that I created were made to expand on another that I observed. The use of ChatGpt in addition to my own response is intended to show a neutral perspective on the polls, as well as simply since it is interesting to see. The source of this data is polls on YikYak’s UCLA community, an anonymous messaging platform where students (must have a ucla email to participate) can post anything and vote on polls anonymously, and is widely used by undergraduate students. The motivation for this post is from observing these polls and sentiments of racial bias and negativity surrounding the dating scene throughout UCLA. 

ChatGpt Initial Response - Here is what ChatGpt first said when instructed to analyze the polls:

⸻

🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Regressive Reality

Source: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)
Respondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (250–300 average per poll)
Margin of error: ±6–8%

⸻

1. Self-Image vs. Reality
	•	89% of students say UCLA is a progressive/liberal campus.
	•	Yet across dating and social polls, behaviors reflect racial hierarchy, gender imbalance, and superficial values.
	•	In short: UCLA is liberal in rhetoric, conservative in social practice.

“Progressive” UCLA still reproduces old hierarchies — whiteness, status, and appearance dominate attraction, while inclusivity remains performative.

⸻

2. The Gender Divide: Women Frustrated, Men Defeated

Female perspective
	•	76% of women say the dating pool is bad for girls.
	•	36% blame “guys have bad personalities,”
	•	21% say “not enough attractive guys,”
	•	21% say “too many short guys.”
	•	Only 1% cite lack of chivalry or money.
	•	In talking stages, 43% of women ended it because they “got bored.”

→ Pattern: Women externalize dissatisfaction — men are the problem (boring, short, immature). Emotional engagement, not materialism, drives their critique.

Male perspective
	•	31% of men say “it isn’t bad for guys.”
	•	49% blame “personal/luck issues.”
	•	Only 13% cite “girls have bad personalities,” and 7% say “girls are too shallow.”
	•	0% say “not enough attractive girls.”

→ Pattern: Men internalize blame and accept their lower leverage. UCLA’s gender ratio and social climate empower women as gatekeepers.

Net result
	•	Women: “Men aren’t enough.”
	•	Men: “I’m not enough.”
	•	Outcome: high female discontent, high male insecurity, and mutual cynicism.

⸻

3. Relationship Norms: Freedom &gt; Commitment
	•	41% admitted to getting with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.
	•	42% (women) and 14% (men) said it’s okay for their partner to attend frat parties without them.
	•	Ambiguous “talking stages” and open-ended loyalty norms dominate.

→ Hookup culture is normalized but distrusted. The result is freedom without security, leading to emotional burnout and disillusionment.

⸻

4. Race and the UCLA Dating Hierarchy

A. Social Segregation
	•	Only 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).
	•	34% say their group is mostly or entirely one race.
	•	Despite campus diversity, social life remains racially siloed.

B. Cross-Racial Dating
	•	71% have dated outside their race.
	•	29% have not — consistent with friend-group segregation.
	•	So exposure exists, but racial boundaries persist in attraction.

C. Racial Preferences
	•	35–40% of men say they have a primary racial attraction.
	•	60–70% of women say the same.
	•	When ranking male attractiveness:
	•	White men: 43%
	•	Latino men: 27%
	•	Asian men: 17%
	•	Indian men: 8%
	•	Black men: 6%

→ Women overwhelmingly prefer white and Latino men; men are more flexible.
This disparity builds a racialized dating economy where whiteness and proximity to it are rewarded.

D. Stated Beliefs About Race in Dating
	•	62% say it’s okay to say you “only like white guys/girls.”
	•	Only 11% call that racist.
	•	31% say it’s “racist to say it, not to feel it.”
	•	When asked why race matters:
	•	70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”
	•	14%: “Family expectations.”
	•	12%: “Political views.”
	•	4%: “Social/economic status.”

→ Translation: Racial preference is normalized and morally insulated.
Students frame attraction as “personal taste,” not prejudice — a textbook case of quiet racism disguised as individuality.

⸻

5. UCLA’s “Liberal but Superficial” Paradox

Category	On Paper	In Practice
Ideology	89% liberal/progressive	
62% say it’s okay to publicly prefer only white partners
Diversity	Highly multiracial campus	
Only 36% mixed friend groups
Gender politics	
Feminist rhetoric, equality ideals	
76% of women find the dating pool “bad” yet drive narrow racial filters
Emotional maturity	Communication, openness valued	
43% of women end things out of boredom; 41% of students admit to cheating/talking overlap
Inclusivity narrative	
“Everyone’s welcome”	
Attraction and friendship still follow a white-centered hierarchy


⸻

6. The Racialized Nature of “Preference”

UCLA’s culture treats race in dating as apolitical, but the data reveal an unspoken racial caste system in desirability:

Rank (for men’s desirability per women)	
Group	% of votes
1️⃣	White	43%
2️⃣	Latino	27%
3️⃣	Asian	17%
4️⃣	Indian	8%
5️⃣	Black	6%

Despite a majority-Asian campus, Asian men rank third, and Black men last — proof that proximity to whiteness, not diversity, dictates desirability.
When 62% openly condone saying “I only like white people,” it’s not just bias — it’s cultural reinforcement of racial hierarchy under a liberal mask.

⸻

7. Emotional Detachment and Performative Progressivism
	•	UCLA students champion tolerance publicly but tolerate racial exclusion privately.
	•	They condemn overt bigotry but excuse racialized desire as “chemistry.”
	•	Hookup culture and online validation amplify superficiality, while political correctness prevents honest critique — producing a progressive façade over regressive behavior.

The campus sells “diversity” as a brand but practices social homogeneity wrapped in virtue signaling.

⸻

8. Gendered Power and Racial Capital
	•	Women hold social leverage — more selective, more critical, and more racially filtered.
	•	Men hold numerical leverage in interracial openness but less choice overall.
	•	Whiteness (especially white men) functions as social currency — accepted by every group and rarely challenged.
	•	Non-white men navigate conditional desirability — admired only if they fit white-coded norms (height, demeanor, physique).

⸻

9. The UCLA Dating Equation

Diversity + Hyper-selectivity + Ideological Progressivism = Racialized Liberalism

	•	UCLA’s dating scene runs on status, aesthetics, and social capital, not genuine liberalism.
	•	The more progressive students claim to be, the more they justify exclusion as “just personal preference.”
	•	The result: liberal vocabulary, conservative instincts, racial hierarchy.

⸻

10. Final Diagnosis

Theme	Core Reality
Inclusivity	
Structural, not personal — students support diversity abstractly, not romantically.
Racism	
Subtle, coded as “taste” or “comfort zone.”
Gender	
Women are empowered but often perpetuate exclusionary standards.
Men	
Self-blaming, less selective, racially more open.
Culture	
Hookup-oriented, emotionally shallow, racially stratified, and quietly elitist.


⸻

🔚 Conclusion: “Progressive” UCLA’s Dating Hypocrisy

UCLA markets itself as one of the most inclusive universities in the country — and ideologically, it is.
But in dating and social life, the polls reveal a different story:
	•	Whiteness is still the apex of desirability.
	•	Racial exclusivity is normalized, not challenged.
	•	Female selectivity reinforces racial hierarchy under feminist language.
	•	Male insecurity sustains it by self-blame and silence.
	•	Hookup freedom masks emotional detachment and quiet prejudice.

UCLA’s dating culture is a microcosm of liberal hypocrisy in Gen-Z America:
a campus that preaches equity but still dates by a racial script written decades ago.

⸻

ChatGpt Response 2 - I felt the first response was a bit too combative between genders, and asked it to make it less so:

Perfect — here’s the tightened and final version: slightly less gender-adversarial, more focused on the racialized social structure beneath everything, and still as direct and data-anchored as before.

⸻

🔍 UCLA Dating &amp; Social Dynamics: Progressive Image, Racial Reality

Source: 20+ anonymous UCLA YikYak polls (2024–2025 academic year)
Respondents: Verified UCLA undergraduates (≈250–300 per poll)
Margin of error: ±6–8%

⸻

1. The Progressive Illusion
	•	89% of students describe UCLA as a progressive/liberal campus.
	•	Yet campus behavior—especially in dating and social life—reflects old racial hierarchies, superficial selection, and cultural clustering.
	•	UCLA is progressive in rhetoric but conservative in social practice.

The campus sells inclusion as an identity, but daily interactions reveal quiet racial gatekeeping and self-segregation beneath a liberal surface.

⸻

2. General Climate of Dissatisfaction

A. Widespread Frustration
	•	76% of women call the dating pool bad for girls.
	•	31% of men say it isn’t bad for guys, while 49% blame “personal/luck issues.”
	•	Both genders describe disconnection and mistrust; almost 41% admit to hooking up with someone else while in a relationship/talking stage.

B. Emotional Detachment
	•	The most common female breakup reason: “I got bored” (43%)—not cheating or incompatibility.
	•	Talking stages rarely lead to stability; freedom is prized, commitment undervalued.
	•	The tone across polls suggests a socially open but emotionally cynical culture.

⸻

3. Racial Structure of Social Life

A. Segregated Friendships
	•	Only 36–38% report multiracial friend groups (no race &gt;50%).
	•	34% say theirs are mostly or entirely one race.
	•	UCLA’s diversity is statistical, not social: cross-racial friendship is limited, creating echo chambers of comfort and cultural sameness.
	•	Those circles strongly influence dating exposure, reinforcing racial preference loops.

B. Racialized Dating Preferences
	•	71% have dated or talked to someone outside their race—but 60–70% of women and 35–40% of men still admit to a primary racial preference.
	•	Attraction rankings (by female voters):
	•	White men: 43%
	•	Latino men: 27%
	•	Asian men: 17%
	•	Indian men: 8%
	•	Black men: 6%
	•	Despite being one of the most Asian campuses in the U.S., Asian men rank third; Black men last.

→ The campus’s social logic rewards proximity to whiteness—the currency of “mainstream” attractiveness and perceived status.

C. What Students Think About That
	•	62% say it’s okay to say you only like white guys/girls.
	•	Only 11% call that racist; 31% say “it’s racist to say it, not to feel it.”
	•	When asked why race matters in dating:
	•	70%: “Only attracted to certain races.”
	•	14%: “Family expectations.”
	•	12%: “Political views.”
	•	4%: “Socio-economic status.”

→ Students treat racial attraction as apolitical and morally neutral, detaching personal preference from structural bias. That’s quiet racism: discrimination that hides behind the language of individuality.

⸻

4. Race as the Unspoken Social Hierarchy

A. In Dating

Whiteness sits at the top of the desirability chain, followed by lighter-skinned or “Western-coded” groups. The closer someone’s look or culture aligns with that standard, the more socially mobile they become in dating.

B. In Friendship Networks

Even friendship data mirror this hierarchy: white and white-adjacent students more often move across racial lines, while Black, South Asian, and some East Asian groups report more insular social circles—less by choice than by exclusion through subtle social norms.

C. In Campus Culture

Greek life, club leadership, and social media trends all reinforce the same optics: certain aesthetics and backgrounds carry higher cultural capital. The racial hierarchy isn’t enforced by rule—it’s reproduced through who’s invited, who’s visible, and who’s desired.

⸻

5. Gender Dynamics within a Racial Frame
	•	Women report higher standards and more disappointment (76% unhappy), but those standards align with the racialized ideals above—favoring whiteness, height, and social charisma.
	•	Men, more likely to be racially open (only 35–40% have a set racial preference), internalize rejection as personal failure (49% blame themselves).
	•	The result isn’t a gender war so much as a shared exhaustion inside a system where attraction and status are racialized currency.

⸻

6. The Progressive Veneer vs. Social Reality

Category	What UCLA Says	What Students Do
Ideology	
89% identify as liberal/progressive	
62% say it’s fine to publicly prefer only white partners
Diversity	
One of the most multiracial campuses in the U.S.	
Only ~36% of friend groups are truly mixed
Inclusivity	
Anti-racist, equity-focused rhetoric	
Attraction patterns mirror Eurocentric hierarchies
Gender equality	
Empowered, self-aware students	
Emotional detachment and blame imbalance
Openness	
High racial awareness	
Low interracial intimacy, high racial comfort-zoning


⸻

7. What “Preference” Really Means Here

At UCLA, preference functions as a socially accepted proxy for bias. Students publicly condemn racism yet privately replicate its logic through dating choices and friend-group formation.
When most people agree it’s fine to say “I only like white people,” they’ve redefined racism as something you commit with hate—not with habit.

This quiet racism is harder to confront because it hides inside “personal taste,” yet it reproduces the same exclusionary outcomes: marginalized groups remain under-desired, under-invited, and under-included.

⸻

8. The Cultural Formula

Diversity + Liberal Branding + Status Anxiety = Racialized Liberalism

	•	The school champions diversity but practices comfort-based segregation.
	•	Students use liberal vocabulary (“preference,” “vibe,” “chemistry”) to excuse inherited hierarchies.
	•	The dating scene rewards alignment with white aesthetics and social norms, not actual progressivism.

UCLA thus becomes a mirror of modern elite America: visibly diverse, verbally inclusive, functionally stratified.

⸻

9. Key Statistics Summary

Indicator	% / Finding	Meaning

89% yes	
Ideological consensus
Women say dating pool is bad	
76%	High female dissatisfaction

~60–70% women, 35–40% men	Persistent bias
Say it’s okay to like only white people	
62%	Normalized racial exclusivity
Multiracial friend groups	
36–38%	Social clustering by race


⸻

10. Conclusion: UCLA as a Case Study in Quiet Racial Stratification

UCLA stands as a paradox: a liberal campus built on racial comfort zones.
Students advocate inclusion publicly but practice segregation privately—in who they befriend, date, and desire.
	•	Whiteness retains symbolic dominance.
	•	Racial “preferences” reproduce the same hierarchies progressivism claims to dismantle.
	•	Emotional detachment and hookup culture amplify surface-level connections while masking deeper bias.

UCLA’s dating scene isn’t just shallow—it’s racialized.
The language of freedom and preference has replaced explicit prejudice, but the outcome is identical: diversity without integration, equality without intimacy.

The campus looks like the future; it loves like the past.

⸻

Personal Response: 
I do believe that a lot of what ChatGpt has to say on this issue has some truth to it, though it does bring in some points that are not entirely supported by the polls and may not be accurate. UCLA is often presented and identified as a diverse, liberal, progressive school, however does not function as such socially. Many students, especially those who are ethically underrepresented struggle to connect with those outside of their own ethnicity, not only in dating but in social settings. UCLA is heavily self segregated socially, in dating, friend groups, greek life, etc. Despite having many different groups and ethnicities represented, there is a lack of true diversity and mixing of such groups. In terms of dating, there is a longstanding narrative that UCLA’s dating pool is bad, especially for women. I believe this comes from a variety of factors, with equal “fault” between genders. It seems that in the current age, but especially at UCLA, traditional social practices are less common. People are less likely to ask each other out, be open to the opposite gender, and be socially proactive. There are definitely some shallow aspects, with too prominent of a hookup culture and a heavy influence on physical appearance. Social media and dating apps definitely play a significant part in this as well. The polls do show a gender discrepancy, however it is worth noting that the girl:guy ratio at UCLA is very skewed and plays a part in this. (though the fact there are less men would typically mean the standards for them should be lower, not vice versa). The racialized nature of dating and social life, and widely accepted nature of expressing racial preferences and white superiority is definitely problematic. It ultimately is racist to glorify one group over others and openly express preference towards one group, and doing so fuels a lot of hateful, harmful, incel/blackpill rhetoric. While it is true that attraction is natural, we should all strive to be less superficial, be conscious of our biases, and work to be more inclusive and careful of what messages we convey.",ucla

Notes:

* This was just recently added on 10/16/2025 to the University of California Information page for the academic year 2024-25, so a little more than a year lagging. My bad, here's the [link](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/admit-destinations).
* UCB reduced enrollment in 2024-25 and thereby accepted only 300-400 more than UCLA. Here are the enrollments of the five -- I didn't include UCSC and UCM, because they're both still gaining their rep. Here are the enrollments of all five:
* UCSD, 7,330

* UCI, 6,735
* UCLA, 6,610, Badly overenrolled

Hi! This is my first quarter at UCLA (new transfer student) and still trying to figure out how Halloween parties work. It looks like most student org/club parties are on Oct 30 this year, but I can only go on Oct 31 or Nov 1 since my friend is visiting.

Do UCLA clubs usually not host parties on Halloween night itself? If not, what do students usually do on the 31st/1st? Also, how do people usually pick which party to go to like through friends, orgs, or just Instagram?

Since I’m an international student and this is my first time experiencing college Halloween, I’d really appreciate it if someone could kindly explain.

Thanks! ",ucla

This message is to raise awareness of certain actions that are arguably unusual and strange. 

(This is my first time making a post like this, but I wanted to share something that made me uncomfortable and might be useful for others to know, especially women on campus)

On Friday (the 17th), I noticed a man walking around UCLA taking unsolicited close-up photos of students (mostly girls) with a high-definition camera. 

He didn’t ask for permission or explain what he was doing. A few of these people tried to turn away, but he kept taking pictures. When I noticed and looked at him, he pointed the camera toward me as well and recorded pictures of me.

I’m not sure what his intentions were, but it felt invasive and uncomfortable. I just wanted to remind everyone to stay aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts if something feels off.

Taking pictures in public isn’t illegal, but if someone’s behavior crosses a line or makes you feel unsafe, you can contact UCLA’s Title IX office or campus safety resources for support.

Advice? Got an Incomplete for one summer class but another was denied — what should I do next?,Terrible_Background4,1760782481,2,3,/r/ucla/comments/1o9s29a/advice_got_an_incomplete_for_one_summer_class_but/,,,"During the Summer 2025 session, I experienced a sudden, severe mental-health crisis that required immediate medical intervention. I live with chronic anxiety and depression, but this episode was acute and incapacitating, leaving me unable to perform at my usual academic standard.

For one of my summer courses, I was granted an Incomplete after providing verified documentation of my medical circumstances. However, for another course in the same session — affected by the exact same emergency — my request for an Incomplete was denied because I had already submitted the final exam. My academic advisor explained that UCLA policy typically disallows withdrawals or Incompletes after the final has been attempted, even in verified emergency situations.

I’m now exploring my options. I plan to request a grade reevaluation with the department chair for the course where my Incomplete was denied and to reach out to the Dean of Students or Case Management Services to see if a retroactive withdrawal or other academic relief might be possible.

I’m seeking advice from the UCLA community: Has anyone successfully received retroactive withdrawal or relief under similar circumstances? What documentation or approach is most effective, and how should I frame my request to the department chair? Any tips for navigating this process would be greatly appreciated.",ucla
"If you use nicotine for focus/studying, I've tried every nicotine gum on the market",NoOrganization377,1760768443,3,6,/r/ucla/comments/1o9odag/if_you_use_nicotine_for_focusstudying_ive_tried/,,nsfw,"26M grad student and if you're not old enough or interested in low-dose nicotine with a strict dosing strategy as a nootropic study tool please stop reading. 

I'm a big fan of modulating acetylcholine in the brain for focus &amp; flow state ever since Lex &amp; Huberman chewed nicotine gum on Lex’s podcast a year back. I'll occasionally take a low-dose nicotine for productivity and it works like a charm. I’m pretty anal about substances so I generally only engage in nicotine during the weekdays at work and when I’m not crazy tired cuz I know that’s when I’ll build a reliance on something. I’ll only use a 2mg and mostly split it in half so the spike isn’t too high because I’m definitely one to crash and anything higher hits too hard. Anyways I’ve been testing out all of the different gums &amp; more recently mints when I saw the blurb about microplastics in human brain tissue since I assume masticating plastic gum is going to lead to this issue. But I’ve been chewing gum all my life so I’m not too worried about it.

I’ve now tried Walgreens, Amazon basic care, CVS, Lucy, Blip, Chewbizz, Quitine, Nicorette, Nicnac and Quit with jones. I looked at price, flavor, texture, sensation, etc. Here’s my very biased take on all these products. So the majority of these are white labeled from contract manufacturers and branded as their own product.

With respect to flavor Walgreens and Blip are for sure the best with the Mint Freeze flavor. But they taste exactly the same, so I’m pretty sure it’s the exact same product but Walgreens is $0.31/piece and Blip is $0.80/piece unless you buy bulk then it’s about the same price.

It seems like Amazon basic care &amp; Nicorette are like the same brand with the same flavors but Amazon is the cheapest if you’re just trying to essentially get free nicotine gum lol it doesn’t even touch the bank account. But Nicorette and Quitine just make you feel fiendish by their branding and I don’t want that anywhere near me.

Lucy and Chewbizz feel like the most rebellious and innovative, like if you see their marketing they both feel like startups in Silicon Valley. I know Lucy was founded by the guys from the Tech Bros podcast and Chewbizz looks very new judging by their accounts on social media. Frankly, I don’t even bother with Lucy because the flavors are way too sweet and it’s twice as much as the others. Chewbizz is for sure the most expensive I’m not buying this in bulk it’s $0.80/piece but they justify it by having a biodegradable gum base and a nicotine analog along with vitamins in the gum.

I for one don’t know if I’ll ever get used to a natural gum base, it gets way softer by like minute 15 then you kinda want to spit it out though I’m not parking it. But they almost guilt trip you into chewing it cuz you know it’s not plastic and has vitamins. The main redeeming quality is the sensation is different than nicotine, it feels way less addictive and I feel stimulated for like 2/3 times as long with more of the flow state feel than the others so that’s a big plus. You just can’t get it on Amazon or stores so waiting longer for shipping is annoying.

Lastly the mints are pretty easy. Quit with jones has the best packaging out of all of the products I’ve tried but you can’t split the mints in half, so minimum dose is 2mg. The Nicnacs are bigger (3mg) and you can at least split them in half. Flavor is whatever, nothing like the gums but you’re also not chewing anything so it’s pretty discreet. The one thing is the mints have to be parked or the absorb almost instantly, and I’m not a pouch guy because my teeth are way too important to me than to be having long term gum recession &amp; pain.

Best price is Walgreens/Amazon.
Best nootropic sensation is Chewbizz.
Most discreet/lowkey is Nicnac.
Best branding is quit with jones.

I’ll realistically be cycling between Walgreens, Chewbizz and Nicnac for the foreseeable future. Walgreens cuz they have the best flavor and the price is a steal, Bizz because the sensation lasts longer and it feels better for me, and Nicnacs when my jaw gets tired though parking is not my MO. Anyways, 2mg or less once or twice per day during big grind sessions has been amazing, and I won't even think about chewing it outside of my desk and a couple places. I don’t know if I’m missing anything but would love to hear your thoughts. Cheers &amp; happy studying!",ucla

Given how specific and highly compensated this couple’s case is, she figured the odds were low anyway, so no harm, no foul. She also confirmed she won’t be added to Donor Concierge’s general donor database since she only expressed interest in this one situation.

For what it’s worth, my daughter’s entire interaction with Donor Concierge seemed professional and above board. That said, after reading through all the comments here, it’s clear that anyone considering egg donation should do their research and proceed with caution. If my daughter had gone further, we absolutely would’ve hired an independent attorney to review all contracts and protect her interests.

Stay safe, everyone, and thank you to the UCLA community for the helpful discussion.

**Update 2 (10/20)**: Donor Concierge reached out to my daughter today (she filled out their website form over the weekend). Here’s what she found out:

1. The couple is ethnic Chinese, U.S. citizens, and the reason the offer is so high is that they’re hoping to find an egg donor who physically resembles the would-be mom. They do not need a surrogate.
2. The mom herself has gone through 6 unsuccessful rounds of IVF, and both parents are in their 40s.
3. The 250K is a firm 250K (not an “up to” bait-n-switch) with all related medical, legal, and travel expenses covered on top of that. There’s also a 10K bonus for a person (or organization) who refers the selected donor. Everything would be guaranteed by a written contract.

My daughter sent in some current photos plus some baby pictures that I helped her gather. She’s not committing to anything, and she’s being careful by researching both the medical and psychological side of things and not just taking Donor Concierge’s word for it, since obviously they have their own incentives.

**Update:** Wow, I didn’t expect this thread to blow up like it has! I apologize if I made it sound like I’m encouraging my daughter to be an egg donor. SHE is the one who’s very interested and texted to get my thoughts (I’m a single dad). Anyway, we looked up Donor Concierge and it appears to be a legitimate family planning center in San Rafael, CA. My daughter says she’s going to fill out the form and, if they contact her, just have a conversation with them to learn more. She swore she wouldn’t proceed any further unless and until all concerns raised (please keep them coming so I can pass them along to her!) are fully addressed. I’ll update this thread again when I know more, thanks!

**Original Post:**  
Hey Bruins, posting here as a slightly confused (and maybe mildly panicked) dad.

My daughter’s a student at UCLA, and she texted me a photo of this flyer someone handed her on campus today. It says “Help Us Start a Family” and offers $250,000 to an East Asian egg donor — plus a $10,000 referral bonus. It looks professionally printed and mentions a company called “Donor Concierge” that claims to be BBB accredited, but still… the whole thing sounds like something straight out of a Netflix true crime doc.

She said someone was passing these out on campus. Has anyone else gotten this? Is this some kind of elaborate scam, or (somehow) an actual thing?

As a dad, I’m half “this sounds way too good to be true” and half “if it is true, that’s more than my college tuition was.”

Appreciate any info from current students who’ve seen it or know what’s up — I’d just like to make sure my kid’s not about to get kidnapped by a fertility startup.",ucla

Advice deciding between CSE at UCM and SE at SJSU,NOimDirtyDan--,1761439893,11,3,/r/ucmerced/comments/1og7i87/advice_deciding_between_cse_at_ucm_and_se_at_sjsu/,,,"Hey everyone,

I’m transferring for Spring 2026, and I’m torn between Software Engineering (SE) at SJSU and CSE at UC Merced. Both have strong appeal for different reasons, and I could really use some insight from current students (especially UCM CSE majors) before I make my final decision. 

**Here is how I see It and some questions I have about the CSE program:**

If I go to UCM, I’d be commuting from home (about 45–60 minutes), and although I would also be commuting/carpooling to SJSU, the much shorter commute to UCM would save me a lot of time and energy to dedicate to school and everything else. 

That said, something I’ve noticed when looking through UCM’s upper-division CSE courses is that a lot of them are intro classes or theory-focused, rather than applied or project-heavy. I know that’s  the nature of the researched based UC system, but it makes me wonder how much actual hands-on experience you walk away with.

**CSE Career Questions:**

1. How competitive or effective are the internships available to CSE students? Are most local, remote, or more research-based?
2. How is networking and the alumni connection here? do professors, clubs, or past students help with internships or job leads?
3. How is the capstone/senior project structured? Does it give you real hands-on, team-based experience like what you’d get in industry?
4. How well do you feel the CSE program actually prepares you for the industry? Do you leave feeling confident in your technical skills (software design, teamwork, version control, etc.), or is it more academic/theoretical?

**CSE Campus/Academic Questions:**

1. How realistic is it to find on-campus IT or SE-related jobs (like help desk, systems support, or web dev)? I have a year of experience working for my CC's IT Help Desk and would love to find a campus job at UCM. 
2.  Has registration started already for Spring 2026?
3. Are most upper-div classes only offered in person, or are there online/hybrid options available?
4. Has Spring 2026 registration started yet, and are there any classes that tend to disappear quickly?

**TL;DR:**  
I’m deciding between SJSU’s Software Engineering and UCM’s Computer Science &amp; Engineering programs for Spring 2026. I’d really appreciate honest input from current or past UCM CSE students, especially about how well the program prepares you for the industry, internship and networking opportunities, and overall campus experience.

**Note:**  
If anyone would be open to answering some of these questions more in-depth, I’d really appreciate doing a quick call or Zoom chat sometime. As you can tell I’ve got a lot of questions and would love to hear directly from someone who’s been through it. Feel free to DM me if you’re up for it! Thank you🙏",ucmerced

I’m creating a student-run Discord hub for the UC Merced psychology community. That is to say it is not affiliated with UC Merced. I'm of the belief that having separate servers for every class involves too much friction. This server is meant to consolidate psychology courses into one space.

It includes nearly every Psych course for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026, subdivided by section and set up with react roles so you can easily join your current classes (and drop them when you’re done). Courses and sections will be added for each new semester as the course schedule releases from UC Merced.

I am hoping that a central space makes it easier to find classmates, share notes and relevant materials, stay connected, and ask questions in a group forum. You are welcome to share the link with peers in your psychology courses.

Unless you want to experience both hatred and isolation due to your sexuality I’d suggest you go somewhere else. While the university itself including the staff are very accepting for the most part, and the university purposefully tries to come across as being for the students, it’s the student body that makes everything else insignificant. Majority of the men on this campus either are homophobic, or aren’t homophobic but still aren’t the most accepting. You’ll find a few good ones, but it feels as though everyone is always negative, they’re just tolerating your sexuality because they have to. As a gay guy it’s hard to find real friendships with other guys, causing you to resort to being in friend groups with only other women. You try and be nice to a guy trying to become his friend, but everyone here is so childish that they automatically assume that you’re hitting on them. And on anonymous apps like Fizz, students actually spread rampant homophobia constantly. I’ve actually experienced hateful comments and other harassment in person due to students at this university, based solely on the fact that I don’t hide my sexuality. On top of this hatred, being that you’re in such a small environment away from the actual town of Merced, it creates a sense of alienation with nothing you could really do about it, especially without a car. The gay male community here seems so small, which causes the actual gay men here to come across rude and arrogant as a defense mechanism. Especially when it comes to looking conventionally attractive or not. The culture here is that if a gay guy seems conventionally attractive (ie works out, is handsome, etc) the straight men seem to tolerate him more. Giving them a superiority complex, and pitting different gay guys against eachother. And god forbid a gay guy here portrays his femininity. And this is just in relation to platonic relationships. Gay men at this university, at least from what I’ve seen as a student, don’t really find love or romance. Sure there are a few that get lucky, but if you want any romantic connection you need to resort to gay hookup apps like Grindr or Sniffies. And the culture on those is even worse in the town of Mercedes. Students are explicit with their hatred, causing gay guys who want to experience stuff like that to resort to risky sexual encounters with much older men on those apps. The system itself is extremely negative, and it seems as though it’s going to continue at least for the foreseeable future. If you’re a gay high school senior applying to colleges, coming from another gay guy who’s stuck here due to his mental health depleting and his grades dropping, please just pick any other UC or CSU.

I have a 3.6 unweighted GPA, 4.2 weighted GPA, and a 3.93 UC capped GPA.

I am interested in UC Merced because, from what I’ve heard, it has great research opportunities and great professors. UC Merced has the highest amount of undergrads involved in research within the UC system. Also, I believe the smaller class sizes compared to larger UCs also allow for a better learning environment because of easier access to professors.

After college, I want to pursue a PHD in some field of Physics. I think UC Merced is a great choice for me to apply to because of its smaller learning environment, easier access to professors, and opportunities to do research, which are heavily important for pursuing a PHD.

Are my assumptions correct? Is there any advice you can offer? How is the Physics Department at UC Merced? How easy is it really to get involved in research? At what year do students usually get access to research opportunities? Are there any other opportunities Physics majors have access to at UC Merced other than faculty-guided research?

* ~~One of his former students raged so hard to SteamPlug being so buggy, and soon Professor Angelo got very mad that (I forgot the rest..)~~ SteamPLUG is still in the beta stages, which unexpectedly could present bugs, however these bugs have remained minor.
* Someone claimed that his class was too easy so starting this year including this semester (Fall 2025), he made the classes a bit more harder
   * He started mentioning to me and  the whole ITP class that he wants us to start doing stuff on our own
      * Actually yeah, we haven't been receiving homework, which to be fair, we were to experiment the code on our own anyways. Not bad.
   * He also began hiring some tutors (not sure who) starting this week bc the quiz scores from the past were becoming poor
      * His tutors are meant to help students who receive bad scores on their quizzes and improve their grade



* SteamPlug is owned by him

Edit 21/10/25: Some of these rumors are true, but he's not a bad professor in person after weeks of having him. Trust me. See my long comment for the explanation. I've also denied the false promises of these rumors after several experiences.

I am from Sacramento, and I do not have a good opinion of the general Merced area, as it is relatively lacking development and has a higher crime rate, although I know anywhere can be dangerous if you aren’t practicing basic safety precautions.

I have a 3.6 unweighted GPA and a 4.2 weighted gpa. I am in the top 12% of my class (not 10% sadly, as I heard that makes admissions in some way easier). I am currently in the process of filling out my UC PIQs, and I want to know more about UC Merced.

If I were to be accepted, I would hopefully be majoring in the Neuroscience, B.S. Pre-Medical Emphasis program for premed. After graduation and the MCAT, I would want to attend medical school.

Although I am aware that I haven’t  even applied or been accepted to any schools yet, I am considering UC Merced over other UCs because of its smaller student body and perceived abundance of opportunities. I am aware that UC Merced does not have as high of a premed/medical reputation as schools like UC Davis, but I feel like UC Merced’s smaller class sizes would fit me better and give me more of a community experience.

I will get quicker to the point with a list of questions:

- UC Merced has the greatest amount of undergrads in research within the UC system due to its smaller student body. Are there also good research opportunities for premed?

- Is admission into UC Merced reasonable with my stats? 3.6 unweighted GPA and 4.2 weighted GPA. Top 12%. I believe my UC GPA is 3.87.

- Are there good extracurricular opportunities for premed, such as shadowing and volunteering at a local hospital or practice? In particular, I am interested in Family Medicine.  I am not familiar with the Merced area.

- How is UC Merced as an Asian? I am concerned about how I would fit in, as there is a significant difference in Asian presence in Merced compared to Sacramento.

- How is the campus and school environment? Is it a good learning environment? How much pressure and competition is present? How beautiful is the campus?

- How is the town of Merced now? What kind of experience does it offer? I need hotpot to survive. Is the crime as bad as some people say?

- Is UCM a commuter campus? I’d preferably want a larger on-campus experience and have more social exposure. Of course, I would proactively engage with others and join clubs too.",ucmerced

These folks teach the first-year writing courses, and some Spark courses, which help ease students into University life. They learn student names, write letters of recommendation, and more importantly, care about their students. 

They have been pivotal to the success and rankings so often touted by Chancellor Munoz, but they are being laid off so more admin bloat can fester, increase class sizes, and sacrifice your educational success for their excess.

If you care about your education and what Merced purports to offer you, then it’s time to send emails - non-stop - to the Chancellor and Dean and tell them this has to stop. Teachers teach. Admin do not. You are here to be educated, and no amount of administration will change that. ",ucmerced

UC Merced - A Story of Mismanagement,ubungu,1757618281,24,79,/r/ucmerced/comments/1nehu7a/uc_merced_a_story_of_mismanagement/,,,"Hi all,

So I just wanted to quickly rant about how fucking awful this campus has been run since the day I got here 6 years ago. Seems like it’s topical given the recent parking problems, and since this has been bouncing around in my mind for a while I wanted to get it off my chest. Before I really get into it I wanted to be very clear and say that I actually love UCM. I did my undergrad here, I continued to grad school here, and this city and campus have become a part of my life. My main gripe is with campus administration, and I think you’ll agree after reading this that they are the main obstacle to having a university we can be truly proud of. 

Let’s start with housing. When I first came here in 2019, there was a of directly associated off-campus housing with contractual obligations to the UC. Additionally there were the existing dormitories that are on campus today, some of which were under construction at the time. The dorms on academic walk were famously constructed by contractors who had rub shoulders and I must assume greased the wheels of campus admin, rather than winning their supposedly “competitive bid” honestly. It’s these same contractors that chalk up the lack of drop ceiling and exposed utilities to post-modern design and “ease of maintenance.” This decision is what allowed a student in the very first year of Glacier Point’s opening to hang from a water pipe on the 6th floor, causing to to break and rupture, thereby flooding the entire building. Say what you want about the kid, what kind of idiotic design doesn’t account for the fact that college students do stupid shit and maybe utilities shouldn’t be exposed???? The kind of design that doesn’t require any thinking and has the soul goal to extract as much money out of public funds as possible.

Second, let’s address food. Some of you may know about the absolute debacle that was the pavilion dining center immediately after COVID. For those of you who don’t, it was truly a horrific sight to see. Some famous highlights: bugs in the vegetables, Chernobyl burger patties, undercooked chicken, and skyrocketing cases of food-borne illness. I won’t spend too long on this because it’s been covered extensively, but there were two central issues with how the pavilion was operating. One, some of the absolute cheapest possible ingredients were being sourced from Sysco, resulting in really low quality to start with, and student workers at the pav were zoinked out of their minds. Literally hearing directly from employees that students would clock into their shift high, drunk, and even crossed, resulting in frequent mistakes in food preparation. Now you might ask, why? Ok sure, we all hate our jobs, but why are people making these decisions, coming into work so blasted that they can pretend it’s not their reality? Because the working conditions at the time were fucking awful, because they were criminally understaffed and underpaid, and because the pav admin didn’t care. See, something you need to understand to make sense of all these decisions is: the dining centers are not actually owned and operated by the university. Or rather, they are, but these entities exist as “private companies” within the UC system as a whole. These companies are in a funny situation. You see, they are expected to make a profit, but their income is mostly fixed. Given that most people who eat at the pavilion are on campus residents who pre-purchased a meal plan, the pav as a company doesn’t actually have to try to compete for your money. Given that the two DCs are the only fixed dining options on campus, and on campus residents have to pay extra to eat from the fairly inconsistent food trucks, they don’t even really HAVE any competition. Consider that on weekends, students literally only can eat at the DCs or pick up microwavable food from the student store, and I think you’ll understand my point. The DCs aren’t beholden to anyone, especially not their customers or employees. Students are forced to eat subpar food (which I will admit has gotten a little better over the years but is NOTHING compared to the food at other UCs) and workers are forced to work with scolding water without protection, their hours are not respected for class times, and they are underpaid leading to understaffing and overworking. This is remarkably different from how they operate UCLA’s dining hall, widely regarded as the best public university dining hall in the country. Now, why would a campus necessity, something that other campuses have proven can be better operated as part of their Housing, be operated as a private entity? Well that simple. To “save money”, UCM’s Project 2020 (which constructed the pav and all the dorms on academic walk) was operated as a public-private partnership. Using public funds to get private companies to build projects for the UC with a catch: the pavilion is, to this day, paying off its construction as well as accruing contractually mandated profits for Plenary Properties Merced, a shell of Plenary, a company the specializes in the business of public private partnership. Meaning they have no attachment to this campus, no obligation to run a real business, no interest in reinvesting all the money they have extracted out of this community back into it. 

Finally, TAPS. Ooohhhhh TAPS, I don’t think I’ve ever hated an entity as much as you. TAPS is actually the first element of campus administration to ever have been privatized, with its inception back in 2005 along with the beginnings of campus. Turns out, TAPS actually owns all the parking lots as their “own land” and to build the current work on housing and the potential future work on the student union, the university will have to “buy back” the land from ITSELF. Now that’s not really the most egregious thing. If anything, that’s just a matter of paperwork and shuffling money around. No, TAPS, although owned indirectly by the UC, is separately operated on a contractual basis by Laz parking. ",ucmerced

Hello everyone! I've commented on this situation before on other posts but this is my first time doing my own post. As we know it the Bellevue lot is a hellish nightmare almost all hours of the day. I had class at 10:30am and got to the lot at 9:30am. The lot was FULL to the brim with cars already circling around trying to find a space. I had to park all the way in the back but by the green pathway and my class is in COB1. I come back after the long day to this ticket. Where I stand now is that I am REFUSING to pay and appealing. I encourage any commuters who get tickets to APPEAL APPEAL APPEAL! The campus does not deserve any more cash, it is an unjust bill for us. The permit is already full price and expensive for the amount of parking they are providing. 

Before the semester started I emailed TAPS about my worries with this construction at Bellevue and was ghosted, but now they want to present me a bill??? DRINK DOGWATER!",ucmerced

What plans does UCM have to address the parking disaster?,internetbooker134,1756847504,14,40,/r/ucmerced/comments/1n6vrgf/what_plans_does_ucm_have_to_address_the_parking/,,,Parking is terrible on campus this year especially since the new dorm construction took away a huge chunk of the lot. Does campus admin have any plans to expand the Bellevue lot or build any new lots to accommodate for the spots lost? I heard rumors that they have long term plans to build a parking garage but I honestly don't see that happening anytime soon. Can we complain to TAPS about this because it's affecting a huge number us and especially commuter students ,ucmerced

1. Build a community that creates cool things
2. Share knowledge through mentorship and workshops
3. Supporting others and holding each other accountable.

Last year we had over 100 members come together and create groups to work on their projects! To help these projects succeed, we provided mentoring, workshops, and funding (if needed).

We also do weekly events. We played Minecraft, competed to see who could build the tallest Spaghetti tower, and talked to experienced developers!

If you're a beginner, don't be afraid to join! We're here to help you. (plus, google looks nice on your resume 👀)

PSA: Start planning things ahead of time. Do not wait till the last minute!!,AlpNexus,1756760720,3,19,/r/ucmerced/comments/1n60qod/psa_start_planning_things_ahead_of_time_do_not/,,,"As someone who recently graduated in high school, trust me, school workload will not get easier as the school year progresses. I used to do things and plan them on my mind, but I easily get too caught up with unexpected events that interrupt my daily routine. Shortly realizing that Canvas puts in assignments as modules, I see that modules are divided into sections with each having an assignment due at a specific date &amp; time and maybe a pop quiz or two. Unlike high school, everything is laid out for you, no need to wait until the professor assigns the work.



To start planning the assignments, divide them into portions for each of the day you will do before the deadline. I recommend using a calendar system that can automatically schedule things that can adapt to your routine. I personally use [Reclaim.ai](http://Reclaim.ai) for this, but you can use whatever you like free or paid. I think for Ios users, [FlowSavy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowsavvy-ai-schedule-planner/id1620112581) is one of the popular options.

Merced Station: A Review - Callous Scam or Overhated Luxury?,Several-Willow-9334,1756177843,7,16,/r/ucmerced/comments/1n0az5m/merced_station_a_review_callous_scam_or_overhated/,,,"DISCLAIMER: No, I am not a shill or an employee working there. I am a first gen second year student that currently lives there and I didn't come from the richest background, so bear with me. I know I've only lived here for a week now but I felt the urge getting this out.

I've noticed around here that Merced Station (MS for convenience) hasn't had the most positive reception in this subreddit, mainly due to its over pricing. Yet, despite your guys' warnings, I decided to live there because I figured it would be more cheaper than living in the dorms again, not to mention my experience with the dorms on campus wasn't the greatest.

At first I was very skeptical for how high the rent rates were, especially for singles, so I opted to live in a 6 person shared unit, sharing a room with another person. But over my time living there, I noticed that there were many things that have come out of this place. I'll sum MS's pros and cons.

The Good: 
- MC's bus transportation is actually pretty good if you do not have a car to go to campus. They operate from 8-4:30 from Monday to Friday. On weekends, I recommend getting a decent bike to travel to campus.
-You can control your AC at MS to any temperate you want. 
-There's a good amount of places to hang out at MS. The pool, the gym, your own room, BBQ pits, the clubhouse, entertainment center and even an indoor movie theater.
-For bike owners, there is a bike rack in which you can store your bike. Not at lot of people in my building own a bike, so there's plenty of space.
-Since many people are busy doing something else, places like the gym and the pool are not overpopulated.
- The units themselves aren't bad. They have a kitchen, a living room and a washing machine and dryer near your room. The room itself are also bigger than the dorms. 

The Bad: 
- The rent here... yeah I can understand why people are critical about MS. For a unit with only two people living in it with separate rooms, the rent is like $1300. Absolutely insanity. You also have to pay for the move in fee which can cost over $1000.
- Hidden costs actually persist. For example you also have to keep in mind that you have to pay for utilities and an optional service that reports your payment history to credit bureaus. Fees and fees just hand up to themselves. 
- Service can be very unhelpful, especially online, though that's very typical for places like this.
- You cannot request to move into a new unit if you get chanced with a bad roommate (to my knowledge, someone fact check me on this).
- Biking to campus during the afternoon can be hellish. Like, man it's only for 15 minutes but Merced isn't the most car friendly town. At least the distance from MS to the UC isn't too far.
- If you're living with 6 other people like me, and your arrived last, you're gonna have trouble finding space for your dining plates and food, unless you're willing to commute eat on campus.

The Ugly: 
- It can get a bit boring at times. If you're wanting to make new friends here, it will be a bit difficult as everyone is busy with their own lives. 
- The parking here is mid because it's usually limited to residents and is compact. But at least it's better than leaving your cars out in the hot sun with no shade at all!
- Some gated doors are broken. Idk if this is a good thing or a bad thing as a robber may get inside, but at least you don't have to use your keys.
- You must inspect your room and kitchen and living room and bathroom for any damages within 72 hours of moving in or else they won't fix it unless you pay them really high. Luckily, this did not happen to me [yet].

My experience so far: Unlike what most people are thinking, I actually think it's not that bad? Lemme explain myself first before your raise your pitchforks and torches. Like yeah, there's some practices that MS that may warrant some hate from people, but I'd say that if you're looking for a better life out from the dorms and some actual things to do (ignoring rent), then maybe MS is the place for you! To me so far, nothing has really broken down and there's plenty of amenities to do. The issue is that I wish MS was a bit more lively at times just for the vibe itself. 

Final verdict: If do not have the money, then yeah I recommend avoiding this place. Otherwise, MS is what you make out of it. It offers a lot of things for you, and it is your choice to use them as you wish and see if your money is actually worth to stay here. It could be the next step into living on your own from what I theorize. I'll let your responses be the judge. Good night, Merced! ",ucmerced

Some of this might be completely as wrong Ive literally only been in Merced for 2 days, but it's better than Google that's for sure.

By the way, as far as I understand all busses are free as long as you have your cat card. 

First up: Literally everything on Google maps is wrong(as of August 22nd, 2025). If you look up ""bus stop"" it gives you 3 bus stops on campus, literally none of these are still in service lmao. The actual stop doesn't show up.

The stop you're looking for is ""UTC"". It's next to the southern parking lot. It's technically 2 stops right next to each other, UTC south and UTC north. This is where you'll usually get on.

Lines: https://taps.ucmerced.edu/transportation  this site has all the lines(alternatively look up cat track), on weekends only lines E and D are running. It's really dumb since all it gives you is a list of locations and not an actual map of where they are, so you just gotta figure it out(or ask a bus driver like I did) I can tell you that the G line takes you straight to the city center though.

When getting on, scan your id near the entrance and you're good.

I was confused about what the experience of living in Valley Terraces was, since I lived in South Campus for my first two years here. I sometimes walk through Valley Terraces as a way to get to Summits Marketplace, Half Dome game room, the gym, or the YWDC. I was thinking of bringing a TV or an Ethernet cable into my dorm.

UC Merced E-Sports Club,Background-Power8841,1755228603,4,22,/r/ucmerced/comments/1mqmaf7/uc_merced_esports_club/,,,"Hello everybody, I am currently in the process of trying to make an official UC Merced e-sports club. 

The previous semester, I intended to create a club for Marvel Rivals, but this year, I intend to encompass other competitive video games, such as League of Legends, Valorant, and Overwatch. (The unholy trio I know 🥀) More games may be added if there is broad demand.

I also intend to make this a registered organization, so that students across UC Merced striving for a competitive gaming experience in these games have a place to thrive. Currently, there is no active registered organization for any of these games.

Currently, I am doing outreach to look for a UC Merced staff member or graduate student willing to be an advisor for our club. If you are interested in being one or have an idea of someone who may be interested, please let me know.

I encourage all incoming students who are interested in joining to join our Discord, and any interest in being a staff member or assistance with helping me set this up will be greatly appreciated.

Thank You

Just took my kid to orientation and am freaking out about the city and UCM,slkr925,1753971215,65,0,/r/ucmerced/comments/1me2peg/just_took_my_kid_to_orientation_and_am_freaking/,,,"Let me give some quick background. My kid didn’t choose UCM. They ranked top 9% in their HS class and was placed in the ELC program for students. That means if they were waitlisted at any UC applied to, they’d be placed at UCM for a guaranteed UC campus spot. In other words we felt we were playing with house money. Also note that they will be 3rd generation college student, so they aren’t new to being around higher educated individuals. My spouse is also a full professor at another university.

However, after our visit this week, it’s not the slam dunk that we thought and we have concerns.

1. The town of Merced leaves much to be desired. While my wife and kid were at orientation, my goal was to check out the town. Not very vibrant. I can see the potential, but what’s holding it back? Being from the Midwest, it felt like a larger country town.

2. During the intro calls, they indicated there was a regional airport available to get back to Southern California. Turns out that only sits 6-8 and tickets need to be purchased at least 4 months in advance.

3. They also mentioned they can bring car. Turns out that needs a special exemption. That would leave my kid in the middle of nowhere with not great transport options.

4. There’s a high first gen attendance rate. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but my kid was looking forward to finding more of an academic tribe. Not saying that’s not still possible, but seems like it will take a lot of legwork on their part.

5. Some of the students my wife spoke with, alluded to terrible academic counseling and to expect a 4.5 year experience vs completion in 4 years.

The pros that I saw.

1. The campus is beautiful and seems like it will cultivate learning and on campus social life.

2. The new construction shows the investment taking place on campus.

3. The move of sports from NAIA to Division 2 athletics is a good indicator of progress in my mind.

4. It appears there will be plenty of research opportunities for them, but are staff capable of providing effective guidance.

With their AP and dual enrollment credits, my kid will be going in as a 2nd year, which is great. 

As a parent, I just want them to be in the best spot for their success. I don’t want them to settle, especially since they didn’t apply, they were placed.

Any help to alleviate our concerns? Thanks

To what extent does the program prepare students in terms of computer engineering? Is it more in name, is there more emphasis on one or the other, or does the curriculum strike a balance? Any insight would be appreciated!",ucmerced
RECENT GRADS: Worried about life post-college?,Cal-state-journalist,1748895376,1,22,/r/ucmerced/comments/1l1sfdm/recent_grads_worried_about_life_postcollege/,,,"Hi there recent grads!

First off, congratulations on your achievement. You're probably in a situation where you don't know what your next move is after UC Merced. My name is Michael Moreno, and I am a freelance journalist currently covering a topic on recent graduates struggling to find a job post-college and wanted to hear from you.

Reports show that the job market isn't looking as hot, as unemployment rates have jumped to 5.8%: the highest since 2021. While there are many factors that indicate why the job market isn't plentiful, I want to hear from you.

All I ask is 20 minutes of your time to be interviewed over Zoom to talk about why you think you're having a tough time securing a job, what your options are right now and whether you feel college didn't set you up for the ""real world."" If you're not comfortable with interviews but would like to share your insights, feel free to drop a comment below this post and share what's on your mind!

If you are interested in being interviewed, please private message me on here or on my Instagram @/thephotostage, and we'll discuss the logistics of the interview.

I hope you all can share and help me achieve my goal of producing this story!

Thank you so much and have a great day!",ucmerced

Registration question from an incoming transfer student,akirajadetv,1748751735,3,6,/r/ucmerced/comments/1l0g63o/registration_question_from_an_incoming_transfer/,,,"Hi all! I’m an incoming community college transfer student and I had a couple questions about registration. I’m obviously used to how it works at my previous college, but the UCM one is MUCH different than what i’m used to. 
1) What are linked classes? Does that mean I need to enroll in the class that the one i’m intending to register is linked to? 
2) How quickly do waitlists move? I’m used to them moving very quickly especially the last year because of the uptick in cc financial aid fraud/ghost students, but I can’t imagine that’s as big of an issue at UCM. My registration date isn’t til the end of June and most of the classes I want to register for are already full (with open waitlists though)

I took AP Calc AB and one semester of AP Calc BC, fall semester. My school operates on a quarter system, but the school's counselors told us to enter our classes as semesters. Anyway, I ended up taking three quarters of Calc instead of two (one semester) because the AB units were not covered by then. I got a C in the first quarter, a D in the second, then a C in the third (Calc BC). These are the lowest grades I've ever had; the rest of my grades are mostly As and occasional B's. 

Apart from that, I've taken courses at my community college throughout high school (12 classes), same thing, As and Bs until Fall 2024. I got greedy, apart from AP Calc, I took AP Gov, Econ, and lit, and 3 college classes, theater, piano, and drawing 1. I got a D in drawing one (not the quality of work I submitted, but the quantity), but I plan to retake it this summer of 25. I submitted a course update to the school. Is there anything else I can do?

Transfer student here and i'm planning/looking at which courses I need to take and which are available. I'm an applied math major and I've noticed that there are a lot of prerequisite courses that do not fulfill required course requirements. An example is like CSE 31 having CSE 30 as a prerequisite but CSE 30 doesn't apply to any requirements I need so I'll just be taking it solely for the purpose of taking CSE 31. In total I have around 23 courses to take over 4 semesters (with maybe 1-3 classes overlapping some sections) so probably around 21. This is still a minimum of 5 classes a semester PLUS any course that doesn't even apply that I have to take as a prerequisite like I mentioned.

This just seems like a lot and for satisfying the Writing in the Discipline GE I have no idea how I'll take any of the courses without first taking 1 or 2 prerequisite courses.

EDIT: I've realized that 2 upper div math courses satisfy 2 GE requirements as well + didn't realize 1 class was listed as 2 due to a lab. Total classes i'm looking at is 18 + 2-3 at minimum over 4 semesters.

So I transferred from a CC to UCM in 2023. I went through a lot in fall - spring of 2023-2024 and I did a educational leave which got approved for. Fall of 2024 comes and I got diagnosed with early cervical cancer. I did another educational leave which got approved again so I technically started over for the spring 2025 semester. I passed 3/4 classes but the one class I didn’t pass, I communicated for a whole month explaining my situation and how I needed one exam that I missed (which is worth all of my grade btw), and that if I could please make it up. Knowing that I obviously have help from my amazing counselor (Linda Safer), I did a meeting with her and explained that I couldn’t do in person classes and all my professors were okay with it and worked with me except this one professor. She said she would talk to him but he persisted with the “no makeup exams”. Which I get, but that was the only class I needed to pass all of my classes. Which led me to be academically dismissed. 

I went though a lot this semester as well: 
 - mental health
- physical health 
- being a single mother 
- being evicted and having to move 2 hours away from UCM 
- my son getting a UTI from a dishonest and ignorant daycare teacher

Going to UC Riverside or UC Merced doesn’t make your stupid. I’m a PhD student at UCLA and understand the process of admission.,Ill-College7712,1747896696,10,132,/r/ucmerced/comments/1ksk9nq/going_to_uc_riverside_or_uc_merced_doesnt_make/,,,"First, I want to share a bit about my background: I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Riverside and am currently a PhD student at UCLA. I was actually admitted to UCLA for undergrad as well, but I chose UC Riverside due to the cost of living. Although my tuition was covered—since I was raised in a low-income, single-parent household—living expenses in Los Angeles were significantly higher than in Riverside, and that played a major role in my decision.

Now, as a PhD student at UCLA and a teaching assistant, I’ve had the chance to work closely with students. One thing I’ve observed is that, just like at UC Riverside, there are students here who are unmotivated or not particularly engaged. Of course, there are many incredibly bright and driven students at UCLA, but the idea that every student here is exceptional simply isn’t true. On average, I would say that students at UCLA tend to be more ambitious, but that doesn’t mean students at UC Riverside lack drive—it’s just a different overall environment.

I’ve also served on admissions committees, where applications are typically reviewed by a mix of graduate students, retired counselors, and administrative staff—many of whom hold bachelor’s or master’s degrees from lesser-known institutions. Surprisingly, professors are rarely involved in the initial review process, as they are often focused on research. When faculty are involved, it’s usually lecturers or adjuncts—positions that unfortunately don’t carry the same weight or prestige as tenured roles. At times, I’ve questioned whether some admissions decisions truly reflect a deep understanding of a student’s potential.

What I want to say is this: don’t be discouraged. Keep working hard. If you maintain strong grades and seek meaningful experiences, you’ll find success—regardless of which UC campus you attend.

UCM vs CPP CS,Nisiro_,1747617158,3,5,/r/ucmerced/comments/1kpzjsl/ucm_vs_cpp_cs/,,,"Hey all, I'm a 24 y/o CS major who was initially set to transfer to Cal Poly Pomona since I got rejected or waitlisted from all the UCs I applied for. However, UC Merced allowed me to apply through their Count Me In program.
I know CPP is supposed to offer a more ""hands-on"" approach while UCs provide more theoretical foundations for research, but I feel I wouldn't mind either. 
 
In the case I'm accepted into UCM, I'd like to ask for any insight and things to consider in deciding between the two. 
 
I'm already in CPP's MEP program and applied for their Honors College after being invited to do so. Unsure if I'd get housing. I should get priority registration through accessibility services. Their financial aid estimates $14k a year in total expenses. 
 
If UCM ends up offering more FA, I wonder if it'd end up being the better choice... but I hear a lot about the boredom people experience there. I'm no party person, but I still wonder how the quality of life would be like through an academic year. That said, I can also see the benefits of having UC resources and a relatively new campus without the similar competition and class sizes as one would typically expect. More of my credits might transfer towards my major, too, since I took Calc III + Linear Algebra &amp; Diff. EQs this Spring, and those classes either aren't required or don't fulfill a lower div for CS at CPP while they do at UCM. I also ideally wouldn't be staying at UCM for my entire undergrad since I've always wanted to study abroad for a year at some point.

I know that people on this sub would probably be more biased towards UCM, but any thoughts would be appreciated! Especially regarding career outcomes (a little worried about being able to make the connections needed to find internships during undergrad or a job after graduating).",ucmerced

Supervisor Misconduct question,absolutelydari,1761440795,3,8,/r/ucr/comments/1og7sqr/supervisor_misconduct_question/,,,"Hi, does anyone know where I can go to get advice about inappropriate behavior I’m experiencing from my supervisor through my work-study program lab job? The supervisor is a researcher on staff at a lab on campus and I am working in the lab through work-study.

The behaviors include divulging personal problems and information to pressure me to increase my hours, pressuring me to not study for exams or to lower the time I’m studying so I can work, telling me to prioritize working in the lab over family and school, questioning my commitment to the lab when I express a need to study instead of work or if I become sick and am unable to attend work, and expecting me to work on complex tasks without training or proper PPE/required trainings before being legally able to work in the lab.

I just started this job and have already experienced a lot of pressure and inappropriate behavior and I just need to know who I can report this to and get advice on how I can handle this going forward.

Pretty regularly, a girl will compliment my style or say I'm pretty and I just have the urge to ask them if they wanna be friends but my mind goes blank because im so bad at talking to people so i just say thank you and walk away. Other times I'll admire a girl in the gym and i want to go up to her and make friendly conversation but when I smile at them, they won't even smile back. And in class or in clubs, everyone already had designated friends and aren't looking to talk to anyone except for the people they already know or they just kind of hold a surface level conversation with you and you never talk to them again.

Extremely fucked she cheated, but when i asked him did u ever talk to her about it? He said yes but she like was like rlly defensive about it and called him controlling and all that bs. So therefore he just trusted her and that was obv a mistake lol.

I just transferred to UCR from the Bay as a 3rd-year, and I was *so* excited to get started — but honestly, it’s been tough facing what feels like transfer judgment.

I’m a really outgoing person, and I’ve been putting myself out there these past few weeks, going to a lot of recruitment events for both professional frats and clubs. But it’s been discouraging getting dropped just because I’m a 3rd-year transfer — like, that’s not something I can control. It sucks feeling like I’m being judged for my year instead of what I can actually bring to the table.

I know I only have two years here, so I’ve been trying to make the most of it, but it’s hard when it feels like people overlook you for freshmen who have “more time.” Honestly, my community college felt more welcoming than this — it’s been a real culture shock.

At this point, I’m still going to keep putting myself out there because I don’t want to give up, but I can’t help feeling a little discouraged. Has anyone else gone through this? I swear I’m friendly and really don’t like just staying in bed doing nothing — I just want to find my people here.

I’m currently a 3rd year here at UCR and as much as I love this school, I unfortunately haven’t had much of a chance to be social and make friends. I’ve made a few here and there, but nothing substantial. I decided I’d post on here to see if any other guys out there are looking for a friend as well! 

Here’s a little about me! 

I (20, M) am a 3rd year majoring in Business Economics! In my free time I love to listen to music! I listen to most genres, and my fav band is Chase Atlantic! Im also learning how to play guitar and piano! I like to read even though I don’t get much time to do so anymore. I love thrifting, it’s one of my favorite past times. I’m also a big foodie, so I love trying new places to eat! I’m specifically into coffee and sweets, so coffee shops are my go to when looking for somewhere to try. I like video games! (FNAF, Undertale, Stardew Valley) I haven’t played any new ones recently, but I wanna get back into them again. Ive recently been getting into movies! I’m starting to watch more horror movies, so I’ll more than happily take some good recs! I like going to the gym when I can, and I like nature! Hiking, going on a walk, watching beach sunsets are all some of my favorite things to do! Overall, I’m just looking for some guys to talk to and maybe hang out! 

Reddit might not be the best place for this typa thing, but it’s worth a shot! Have a good day/night and good luck with midterms coming up everyone! :) ",ucr

Not sure if this is allowed but I recently developed a system where it would periodically scan animal shelter websites for at risk animals in danger of being put down and automatically posting them on the following discord server:

Because I’m a broke individual and I’m essentially using entirely free services, I’m just having this system scan primarily the Riverside shelters (Coachella Valley Animal Campus, Riverside County West Animal Shelter, and the San Jacinto Shelter)

What Would It Take to Bring “The Barn” at UCR Back to Its Glory Days?,Soft-Inspection-7876,1760214350,26,35,/r/ucr/comments/1o45ucf/what_would_it_take_to_bring_the_barn_at_ucr_back/,,,"I’m a local who’s been curious about The Barn over at UCR. I remember when it had that laid-back, college-town vibe — good food, local music, and a real sense of community. Past years though, it feels like that energy’s kind of faded, and I’m wondering what it would take to bring it back to life.

For those who used to hang there (or still do):
- What made The Barn special to you back in the day?
- What would actually get you to go again if they tried to revive it?

Would things like these help?
	•Live music or open-mic nights
	•Affordable eats and drinks that don’t feel too “campus exclusive”
	•Local breweries or food pop-ups
	•Community events that blend students and locals
	•Or just a more relaxed, authentic vibe like it used to have

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts — especially from current students, alumni, longtime Riverside residents, or anyone who remembers what made The Barn the hangout spot. What would you love to see happen there again?

It was found in the motorcycle parking just up the hill towards parking lot 15.  
I doubt it super valuable, but it may have sentimental value.  
Email me at [mfaloutsos@gmail.com](mailto:mfaloutsos@gmail.com) (I am a prof here).  
After a while I may return it to the campus lost and found.

Just had to say: Went in the server asking for help and ended up getting kicking out, so I went in again. Then I realized it was for SI leaders only before getting kicked out AGAIN. I then decided to go back in one last time so I could get referred to the right place. The dude told me to go to an SI session to find out then proceeded to kick me and ban me. Like I understand you wanna have a little private chat for SI leaders only, but I thought the purpose of SI leaders were to answer questions for those who have them? I got my chemistry questions ready and my test coming soon but I can't get a single ounce of help from the 20 SI leaders available in that group chat? Instead all I got was a ban and I don't know what I should do to get help (office hours don't work, my classes interfere).

Like even if you can't refer me to the right server or do anything about my questions, couldn't you just dm me when I first came in with my questions that this wasn't the right server and refer me an email to the TA who is in charge of chemistry?

Anyway, I’d definitely tip the electrical engineer if they could add one more charging tower near the round seating area.

I’m a transfer and a commuter, so I don’t really have the “luxury” of being close to campus or enjoying everything UCR has to offer.

IDK THE ENERGY COSTS HERE AT THIS BUILDING, but think of it this way. you're bizz coffee shop is a damn hit, i'm sure UCR can afford the extra 100w power... (delicious coffee and food btw)

It’s a 4x4 Modern Single apartment for Girl’s Only on the upper floors. The room comes with its own private bathroom and all utilities are included! (Gas, Electricity, Air Conditioning, Water, Trash, Etc.)

UVT is only a 15 minute walk from campus and is right above the plaza, so lots of yummy food just nearby. It also has a really nice free gym on the first floor for all residents. The parking structure is designated spots per paying resident, so you won’t have to worry about finding a parking spot. Parking ranges from $20-$15 depending on which floor of 6 that you choose.

The apartment: Balcony overlooking Riverside (perfect for sunset pics) on a high floor so it’s safe to go out on the balcony even at night, mini fridge, cute decor, nice roomies, air fryer, and more.

The room itself: Large closet, full sized bed, big desk, private bathroom, pretty view that goes over the city, not the freeway.

The apartment itself has a balcony connected to the living room. The rent is a monthly charge of $1,099. Move-in as soon as possible!

socially frustrated as a transfer commuter,ZaydenM,1759346050,11,9,/r/ucr/comments/1nvhk6d/socially_frustrated_as_a_transfer_commuter/,,,"hello, just venting
I'm a transfer student, first week here. I also commute (not a long distance at all, but I take the bus with no car). I don't know how to make friends. I was homeschooled (non-religious purposes) and then did only school for high school. I did one year of community college in which time I had two in person classes. I would consider myself well adapted and not a weird person at all (exclusively due to having online friends). I'm very academically driven and a thoughtful person. but honestly it feels like that latter bit is to a fault. I feel like I overthink EVERYTHING. I can't do small talk. the only thing I talk to anybody about is name, major, and school related things. I'm also an introverted person, not to an extreme extent but I don't overshare and I find it hard to express myself very hard. it also doesn't help that I'm 18 and in my third year, although I know this isn't really a huge factor.
It feels like every ""normal"" person in this school already has a group of friends to talk to. I feel such a barrier to trying to talk to these people even though they're the people I'd actually want to talk to. there's this dude who was at my transfer orienation and is now in 2 of my classes, so I'm like ""I should probably talk to this guy"" but he already has his group of friends and I just don't know how to do it. I'm NOT really an awkward person, I just have walls up it feels like and it's so frustrating.
the only people I can easily chat up are people in my classes who are not very social. and no offense, but most of them are just kind of weird. I started off sitting at the front of classes because I wanted to succeed and connect with professors, and I'm now finding myself a couple rows back because I just feel like I can't connect with the people in the front for the most part. and then I can't connect with the people further back either who are actually sociable so I don't know what to do.
I also joined a club (ACM) but (also no offense) it's the same archetype of people I don't really care to socialize with. I'm in one of the projects so hopefully there are cool people in that when it starts but I just don't know.
everyone feels so connected already, or not connected at all. I want to be the former but I'm drifting towards the latter and I hate it.
honestly all my self confidence is shot right now. I don't know. hopefully this changes soon but it's just so hard to make friends here for me.",ucr

For context I am a second year PBS major (on paper) but I have been doing biology coursework for the past year in hopes of switching into the major. However, the first year for both PBS and Bio are effectively the same in coursework so this fall has been my first real year doing biology coursework. 
In short, I am taking MCDB1A, CHEM 109A, PHYS 6A+6AL, and CHEM2BL. I have already failed the first physics midterm and will likely be retroactively withdrawing the class and I didn’t do particularly well on my other exams.
This has led me towards wanting to save physics for next year and fill my schedule w PSYCH 10A/B for the winter and spring and declare biopsych+ pre-health so I wouldn’t have to fully switch departments, and the upper division courses seem more interesting as well. 

I’m torn about this decision though because I really want to go into healthcare, primarily dental, but I feel like my academics aren’t very strong, and I don’t even have a job or many clubs taking away from my study time. 

Basically I’m asking this:
- Is pre-med/dental worth pursuing if i’m struggling as much as I am now in lower division courses?
- Should I cut my losses and stick with my on paper PBS major?

I also have a 3.5 overall GPA with a 3.2 in major courses (gen chem didn’t go very well).

The best way to avoid errors and ensure that you're taking the correct classes to progress toward your degree is to **meet with an academic advisor before your pass time.** If you're already in a major, that'll be an advisor in your major department; if you're undeclared, that will be one of the advisors in the College of Letters and Science (https://www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising).

Sad to say, I've seen too many students who did not take this advice — and who suffered unpleasant consequences as a result. A recent unhappy example was a student who needed to take a sequence of required courses for their major. Most students in that major start this sequence in Winter Quarter of their first year, but this student decided on their own — and without consulting with an academic advisor — that they would wait until Fall Quarter of their second year to start. Imagine their reaction when it came time to register for Fall Quarter classes, and they discovered that the first course in this required sequence is only offered in Winter or Spring! This student is now going to either (a) be a year behind or (b) have to take these courses at a community college. Either one of these options means extra time and extra expense for this student to graduate. **Don't let this happen to you!**

So please make a point of meeting with an academic advisor before your first pass time. It will just take a few minutes for them to confirm that your proposed list of Winter Quarter courses is correct — or to suggest changes in that list to help ensure that you're on the right academic track.

Go Gauchos!",UCSantaBarbara

the advisor i talked to last year said it was best for me to not take any base writing classes since id already completed that, and i believed her, but i think doing that screwed me over. should i just bite the bullet and take writ2 so i can get into the classes i want? or is there some way i can petition/ask that my credits be applied the same way as the other exams?

For frosh/transfers who've blocked out the nerve-wracking summer orientation session wherein you registered for fall classes, I've included a screenshot so you can find when your pass times are.

***NOW*** is the time to start putting courses in your registration cart. Set an alarm/Google reminder of when your 1st pass time starts. Don't say to yourself, ""Meh, I'll get on that the next morning..."" That's a recipe for frustration. Register for classes ***as soon as*** your pass time opens.

This may seem elementary to a lot of folks on this sub, but trust me: there are dozens of students every January/week 1 who are scrambling for classes bc they ""forgot about pass times."" Oof.

Also: If there's a winter class you'd anticipated taking that you don't see in ""Find Courses,"" I'd encourage you to contact your department advisors for additional information/clarification. E.g. a student just asked me about MCDB 110 not being available in winter quarter. I reached out to the department and learned, ""Though MCDB 110 Biochemistry won't be offered this coming W26, the plan is to instead offer one very large offering in S26, which will have the equal amount of the usual annual combined seating.  Our 25/26 offerings are listed on our website under [Proposed MCDB courses for 2025-2026](https://undergrad.biology.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025-2026%20Courses%208-28.pdf).""

EDIT: screenshot won't load; just go to the yellow nav bar at the top and select ""Registration"" then select ""registration"" from the blue field. Dates will populate along the right hand side.

ILP Bike Path Update,real_bike_committee,1760637079,7,131,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1o8d46l/ilp_bike_path_update/,,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9vGjzsCJrSzW3YmMnwzGdE2ENkXq7qdTG2kAlILCmB4.jpg,"Dear UCSB Community,

We are the A.S. Bike Committee, the student-led and funded committee that pays for the construction and maintenance of our campus bicycle infrastructure. We would like to provide an update on the progress of the planned ILP Bike Path, and clarify Bike Committee’s role in the new bicycle safety and enforcement program. 

Last spring, after several years of advocacy from the Bike Committee, campus administration conceptually approved a replacement bike path between the Library and ILP. The Bike Committee immediately initiated the planning and design process for a layout that includes both a new path and two roundabouts connecting it to the existing bike network. A preliminary sketch is below. We are now within weeks of receiving the finalized blueprints and cost estimate for the project. At that point, the last step before construction will be raising enough funds to complete construction. Although we anticipate funding to be a challenge, Bike Committee, A.S., and the Office of Budget and Planning will work together to make it happen as soon as possible. We are extremely confident that this bike path will be built. 

We also want to address the widespread concern regarding the ticketing of bikers on walkways as part of the school’s new “Bike Safety and Enforcement” program. We would like to emphasize that Bike Committee did not make the decision to begin police enforcement, and we recognize that increased police presence on campus is never an ideal solution. Our contribution to the program was to develop the educational module offered to cited bikers. Completing the module allows you to completely waive the $40 ticket fine. Bike Committee saw this as the best way to redirect the effort from enforcement to education.

Hopefully this information eases some of your concerns. We appreciate your patience as Bike Committee works towards a permanent solution that supports UCSB’s beloved bike culture.  

[Preliminary design plan by campus architect Ernest Knapp](https://preview.redd.it/xkdw7ffhhivf1.png?width=8550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1949e62e97425970b11012741cbd390cf9c1a2a0)

If you have any questions or input, please contact Bike Committee at [bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu](mailto:bikecomm@as.ucsb.edu)

Looking for people to build (cool cs project) with.,Riddlist_24,1760585104,5,8,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1o7vp2o/looking_for_people_to_build_cool_cs_project_with/,,,"Hi,

I’m a CS major looking to team up with others to build something meaningful. Back in high school, I created a ""prototype"" of this project. It was an adoption platform focused on connecting people with animals at risk of euthanasia. The problem was that everything became very messy and we (a friend and I) ended up abandoning the project. However, I think this project has a lot of potential and I would like to rebuilt it much better, and have it reach a lot a people.

Project: Petbound – an adoption website exclusively for animals at risk of euthanasia

Skills welcome:

\- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS, TypeScript, Next.js

\- Backend: SQL, Python, (still deciding which database)

\- Machine Learning: web scraping, collaborative filtering, reinforcement models for user preference learning

\- Marketing / Business: outreach strategy, user growth, exposure

\- SEO / Cybersecurity: any level of experience helps

I’ve got a structured roadmap ready since I’ve already built a working prototype before—just messy. What I really need now is just a some people who are really interested and want to build this with me.

If this sounds interesting, I’d love to talk and see if we can build something great together. You don’t need to be a CS major—just curious and motivated. And if you already have expertise, even better.

If your primary motivation is your resumé, then I'll add in the fact that I have a very solid plan to make this the largest website for animals at risk of euthanasia in the nation (given that I find enough people to build this), so it'll look great on your resume.

If enough people are interested, then I'll set up a place for all of us to meet &amp; explain my plan for the project in detail and what working on the project might look like.",UCSantaBarbara

I've always been drawn into physics by how fundamental it is to everything surrounding us; I think that I can be applied to almost every other science out there, which is why it is such an important foundation in our lives and society.

While I've always been drawn to it, I've never been confident in which specific direction of physics I want to pursue. By that, I mean that I'm unsure which area of physics I should moving into my masters' years (which I intend to do, but I'm also unsure how to navigate yet), as well as what career or job I should have in mind while I pursue my studies. I'll help y'all out a little bit regarding who I am and what I want in my career: I want a stable, well-paying job (obviously) that I am satisfied with and will complement the BS in physics that I plan to graduate with from college. One important thing that I think that I should mention is that I frankly really dislike working with and around other people, especially for long periods of time; I'm really sensitive to noise and it severely distracts me from focusing, I've never contributed much to groups because I suffer from social anxiety, and overall I suppose that I perform far better by myself academically. I also have poor muscle coordination and I don't really work well hands-on. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm kind of autistic (lol), but I really want to find a career to pursue where those characteristics don't mitigate whatever position or role which I will be in. Also, I know that it probably sounds extremely cliche and like a pipe dream, but I really want to just change the world somehow; just do something where I will be remembered and leave a legacy behind in my name. Again, I'm not sure how or what yet, but I know that's what I want. And that of course leads me to ask which field of physics I should pursue, the steps in order to attain certifiable experience in that field, and how it will complement whichever job might be best suited for me. The steps before entering the job market especially, I am honestly pretty unfamiliar with and don't really know how to use to propel myself towards my career. I commute an hour to my school, so college resources aren't as readily available as I hope they would be. If there's anything specific at UC Santa Barbara that I should look into, please let me know! And this doesn't even cover how and where I should receive my masters from, as well as how to network with people (which is a whole different issue for me).

Basically, I want to know which steps that I should take in pursuit of the career that I want, and even what career would fit me best based on my personality. I just kind of want a roadmap and goals that I can set for myself and follow. I know that there are so many possibilities for my career, especially only as an undergraduate college student, but I really want to have an idea of which direction I should take my future to.",UCSantaBarbara

On the other hand, why the hell did I go to the #1 party school in the country when I’m literally the least party-going person on the planet? I hate alcohol so much it’s not even funny—it’s the reason why I can’t ever see my father again, and it’s the reason why I have such a tense relation with my mother. I can’t stand to be around inebriated people because they make so little sense to me, especially as somebody with Asperger’s and awful social skills, I feel gaslit and hurt and I hate it I hate it I hate it. I’ve been to a few parties also, i know no one’s forcing to me to go them (hence why I commute and don’t like in IV, thank god), but I feel like everybody here drinks and I hate it so much. I’m lonely and I have no friends here. I would normally compromise but drinking goes so against my moral code I simply can’t.

I transferred here last year and recently changed my major, and honestly, I’ve been feeling a little out of the loop lately. My old friend group and I don’t really hang out anymore since we don’t share the same classes or schedules, so I figured I’d try posting here to meet some new people.

I’m 22, into gaming, hiking, and honestly down to try literally anything. Even if it’s a hobby I’ve never tried before, I’m always open to giving it a shot. I’ve been getting into surfing recently (only been out like 5 times, so still very new), and I’d love to find people who’d be down to go out, whether it’s to play pickleball, hike, surf, walk, tan, play tennis, or just explore.

I really enjoy meeting new people, picking up new hobbies, and just hanging out, so if you’re down to chill, study, or go out and do something fun, feel free to DM or comment :)

Winter 2026 registration is approaching. I built a Chrome extension called ""RateMyGaucho"" that brings professor reviews directly into GOLD while you're browsing classes, so you don't have to constantly switch tabs.

The extension is super lightweight and adds:

* UCSB Plat professor ratings displayed right under professor names in GOLD
* Hover tooltips showing overall rating, difficulty, would take again %, and number of reviews
* Direct links to full professor profiles if you want to read more
* Works seamlessly with GOLD's interface without any lag

(Also, RateMyGaucho is now featured on the UCSB Plat home page banner! 🎉)

Here are some screenshots:

**How to use:**

1. Download RateMyGaucho from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ratemygaucho/pgdlhncoocgekdmdiikdlgkndihcobhh?authuser=0&amp;hl=en)
2. Make sure the extension is active
3. Go to GOLD and browse classes like normal
4. You'll now see ratings under each professor's name automatically

I hope RateMyGaucho helps you make better decisions during registration and saves you time from tab switching. It's a new project, so there might be some bugs, and I'd appreciate any feedback you have.

If you're interested in contributing or have ideas for new features, the project is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/itsloganmann/RateMyGaucho).

and ALSO this class’s section is WAY too early. like why do we do this. i wake up at 3pm!! leave me alone!! whoever decided sections should start at 8am should have to attend them themselves.

anyway, if i drop it, i’ll only have 8 units which apparently means i’m not a “full time student” anymore?? like what does that even mean 💀 i’m not an international student, i don’t live on campus, and i don’t get financial aid or scholarships. so does it even matter??

i would be down to find a replacement class, but it’s basically week 3 already?? like can i even add anything at this point?? from what i’ve seen, you need an add code from the professor after week 2, but that just feels awkward to ask for lol.

also… what do i even say to the professor i’m dropping from?? “hi i don’t wanna be in your class anymore it sucks”? 😭😭😭

and honestly i was even thinking about dropping the whole quarter, but of course they made that so difficult with like a million forms and petitions. so even though i want to, i’m not doing all that paperwork crap. these schools swear they care about students but they really don’t. and don’t even get me started on professors who are like “you’re allowed to miss two classes a quarter! 🥺” like GIRL i have a life leave me alone!!!

anyway help a girl out before i go insane. and yes i’m posting this at 5:30am bc i’ve been spiraling about this section since 10pm last night 💀",UCSantaBarbara
Switching to CS,ManyGuava5287,1760078598,9,6,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1o2tpbc/switching_to_cs/,,,"Hi, I'm a second year computer engineering major and looking to switch to CS. I'm primarily want to do this because I don't really have much of an interest in CE as I don't see myself working on chips and other hardware related stuff. This has been because my interests have changed towards working on medtech/biotech related work using CS/AI. Additionally, the flexibility CS has over CE is very important for me as I can invest my time into research, clubs, projects, etc. vs me doing work that I don't want to even do.

My problem is that I have a very low GPA due to a health condition I faced during mid winter quarter all the way until mid spring quarter (\~ 10 weeks) and unfortunately I wasn't compensated for my sickness in terms of exam deadlines (yes for homework here and there but didn't make too much of an impact). Due to my low GPA I don't meet one of the minimum requirements. I'm just in a dilemma right now as it feels like I'm paying money towards classes I don't even want to do that are major requirements while having the possibility of screwing up my GPA even more bcs these are some hard engineering classes.

Does anyone have guidance or potentially been in the same boat to offer help for this. Sorry for the rant but thank you for the help!",UCSantaBarbara

We’re starting **SIGGRAPH@UCSB**, a new ACM SIGGRAPH student chapter on campus. Right now, it’s still in the formation stage, and we’re looking for people who are interested in **computer graphics** in any form.

If you’ve ever been curious about things like:

* How **Blender** (or other DCC tools) actually work under the hood
* How **ray tracing** and **path tracing** algorithms simulate light
* What’s really happening at the **GPU architecture** level when rendering
* How **physics engines** simulate motion, fluids, or collisions
* Or you just enjoy digging into the technical side of visual computing

…then you’d fit right in!

Our goals for the chapter:

* Build a student community around graphics at UCSB
* Run workshops &amp; discussions on rendering, simulation, and GPU programming
* Watch and break down SIGGRAPH papers/talks together
* Connect with researchers, professors, and industry guests in the graphics field
* Contribute to open source projects such as Blender

No prior experience needed — just an interest in graphics technology.

If this sounds like something you’d like to be part of, leave a comment or DM me so we can add you to our interest list. Once we gather enough people, we’ll hold an initial meeting.

Let’s bring a computer graphics community to UCSB!",UCSantaBarbara

    I signed the student housing contract and didn’t cancel it in time in time. (September 1 deadline). I called on September 3rd. Now I am sunk $2700 dollars of rent per quarter because I did not cancel my contract in time. This is a sunk cost. Right now i’m looking at just eating up the $8100 and thanking god that my parents aren’t murdering me for wasting $8100. Housing says the only way for me to be relieved of paying rent is to find someone to take over the bed space. 


    
   If anyone is willing to take over the bed space, I will pay half of the rent for the entire duration of the contract. This means instead of the remainder rent for the year ($7,425) you will only pay $3,712.50 dollars for the year.

   You will assume control of the contract and i will write you a check (or cash) for half of what is owed on the duration of your stay. (date dependent)

I reviewed local coffee shops,caim2,1759535193,14,30,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1nxeysw/i_reviewed_local_coffee_shops/,,,"(This was made awhile ago so probably outdated… no longer in IV :,)

As a pretense, I’m not much of a coffee drinker. Evaluated based off taste, overall vibes, and study spot potential. Dune, Handlebar Coffee, The Arbor, &amp; Coral Tree Cafe I didn’t get to. 

1. Old Town Coffee Goleta
Iced lavender matcha latte: 8.5/10. I usually don’t love matcha, but this one I would order again. Docked off points for the rather tiny cup. All 5 ounces of it was yummy though. 
Ambiance: I originally rated the ambiance lower for the lack of lighting and AC, BUT I had failed to check out the entire cafe! This place deserves its 10/10 for vibes. There is not only abundant seating and charging outlets, there is a bar, ARCADE, pool, ping pong table, AND beautiful, sunny outdoor seating decorated with a fun hippie-like mural and string lights. Not to mention this place is open later than most other cafes I could find in Goleta/SB. I will be back… again, and again, and again!!! Playlist started out very western/country and later became more rnb/indie pop. Definitely some Still Woozy fans present. 

2. Kozy
Caramel latte blended: 9/10. I was pleasantly surprised
Ambiance: A cult favorite est. 2023. The pothos plants that brim the perimeter of this cozy cafe are beautifulllll. This place is fully equipped with AC, clean restroom, and fire playlist. You’ll find other students writing papers and chatting up Hinge dates. 9/10 for the easily lovable aesthetic. 

3. Kin Bakeshop
Strawberry milk: 9.5/10 This drink is delicious, light, fluffy and refreshing. Serving was small but I drank every last drop. 
Ambiance: This place is wonderful. Here you will find kind, hospitable workers, delectable sweet treats, exciting coffee, and aesthetic picturesque Pinterest vibes. It’s not really a place to sit, do work, or go to hang out for long, but it is a great place to stop by with a friend or date and enjoy a morning treat! There is usually a long line in the mornings, so be prepared to wait half an hour to a couple hours. Feel free to come later in the day if you don’t mind missing out on some of the most popular dessert items. Employees and customers alike were so sweet. 8/10 for this category only because I wish it was a place one could spend more time! 

4. Java Club 
Ghiradelli Mocha Blended: too sweet but what do you expect with a Ghiradelli mocha blended? If you want something less sweet order something else. It was yummy though I have an inkling the rest of the menu is delish. 6.8/10
Ambiance: 10/10 This place is beautiful, and I mean BEAUTIFUL. It is a CAFE!!!! I thought places like this went extinct, and if you think similarly, worry not, Java Club has got you. The vibe is earthy worldwide, but also fashionista American mom in 2002. If you know, you know. It looks like what Java Club sounds like, simply amazing. It can get warm in here, but there are ceiling fans and you can take off your freaking coat. Indoor and outdoor seating, some outlets and yes, wifi. They play Cigarettes After Sex. Ugh to listen to Apocalypse while doing work at an earthy cafe drinking a Ghiradelli mocha blended. This is life!!!! Also, I recommend checking out their comedy nights they are quite the vibe. 

5. Caje
Iced strawberry matcha: Very yummy, would recommend. Fruity and fresh. Only a dollar more for 8 ounces more so why not go for the large? Nice presentation too. 9/10
Ambiance: on a hot day I wouldn’t recommend sitting inside, feels stuffy but other than that lots of seating outdoors and it’s a great space to study or meet with a friend. Extra points for being in IV and open til 8pm. Minus a point for no restroom, like, is that even legal? 7.5/10

6. Dean
Vietnamese Iced Coffee: 8/10, it was soooo big and very yummy. It was actually so big I didn’t finish it. I was very energized, it did the trick.
Ambiance: 8/10 This place is the best work-type environment by far. It’s clean, minimalistic, has great lighting, and just feels easier to focus on because of its intentional choice of decor. Focus-inducing environment, only docked off points because your purchase buys 2 hrs of wifi

7. Dart
Iced Churro Latte with Almond Milk: 6.5/10, I don’t really taste the churro aspect of this churro latte… The drink itself is fine, but not a must have. It’s not too sweet and not too bitter. It has a slight cinnamon sugar flavor. It’s a light coffee drink. 
Ambiance: 8.5/10 This place is so colorfully &amp; beautifully decorated. Its ceiling is adorned with what must be a hundred lanterns and the shop is the perfect combination of cozy, bright, clean, and fun. The reason for the docked off points here is because this is not a spot meant for working, but perhaps that’s part of its charm. There are zero outlets available for customer use and this makes it challenging to spend more than two hours here with a laptop. If you want a spot to enjoy company with a friend, grab some caffeine or a bite to eat, or just enjoy a moment in a place that feels just so Santa Barbara, this spot is for you.",UCSantaBarbara

If you click the link, which btw I don't think I've ever seen an official UCSB link that looked like the one in the email, it sends you to a google sites page that tells you to click another link to be redirected to the SSO page. If you look at the URL you can clearly tell that it is NOT the official SSO login page (I posted both URLs for reference \[the official one being sso.ucsb.edu\]).

While some of our landlord’s claims for withholding money are valid, others are unjust. For example, it seems as if they charged us for repainting the entire apartment despite there being almost no damage to any paint (the only damage was one cabinet shelf). Compared to the rest of our complex, we moved out fairly late and it seemed as though they were repainting the entirety of every apartment, which makes us reason that this is normal procedure for every apartment after tenants move out, and we’re pretty sure they can’t charge us for if it’s routine. When we asked for evidence of damage and for itemized receipts, they provided photos that did not match the amount of work that they charged us for, and did not give any detailed receipts at all. We were only given an invoice for painting from the painter, and we were charged extra for having to paint the ceiling, however our landlord did not provide photo evidence of any damage to the ceiling, which would violate AB 2801 and civ. code §1950.5 if we’re not mistaken. Additionally, they charged us for cleaning that they themselves described as being normal wear and tear. After talking to the IV tenants union, we are considering small claims court and we would like to know if anyone has experience doing that, and how that went.

Financial aid,Earev004,1758849234,3,10,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1nqo8cb/financial_aid/,,,Why is the financial aid office this year being so slow and just doing a shit job. I applied for an appeal which got approved a whole month ago and somehow not only did they take their sweet time giving me an award letter but when I opened it they gave me basically nothing. First year I paid out of pocket. Second year I had to drop my housing contract and find a place within a month and let’s not get started that before that I got scammed. Now third year the aid is bullshit. Each year they got me with some new shit as if they don’t want me to get this damn degree. Either way what was the whole point of an appeal if they’re still going to give me the left overs. I literally tell them I’m highkey homeless and they think it’s cute to give me so little. Not to mention i didn’t get a middle class scholarship as if I’ve got any damn money to my name. Let’s not even get started on the fact that they keep trying to get me to take out loans as if they’re going to pay for my shit. In this economy for an immigrant student that’s kind of the most stupid choice you can make. I’m not even going to have a job post graduation and they want me to get deep shit into student debt.

1. Don't swerve and keep right. If you're passing someone, pass on the left and return to the right side of the lane as soon as you can. On a realted note, keep single file, it's near impossible to pass people riding tandem, especially during peak traffic. 
2. Call out when you're passing. It makes it easier to pass if they know you're there.
3. As a result of the last point, KEEP YOUR DAMN HEADPHONES OUT OF YOUR EARS. You need to be able to hear the world around you, you could seriously hurt someone. Hearing callouts is important.
4. Yeild to traffic already in the roundabouts. Last year I got ran off the road by someone who didn't yield, not a particularly pleasant experience.
5. Lastly, just pay attention. Knowing the above also means that you know when it's safe to break these principles, but you still need to know your surroundings.

As someone who tends to ride faster than traffic, PLEASE listen to help keep us all safe. I'm done ranting but as a closing note damn y'all really need to learn to ride a bike with other people nearby.

  
PS- Scooters please keep out of the damn bike racks: you're not even supposed to be allowed on campus. You're also not an exception to the above points, and honestly I could write a whole other post about all y'all.",UCSantaBarbara

I was going to take this course because I wanted to take a C LIT course at UCSB, but the professor just sent out a message with everything we need for the course. Maybe it's because I've never taken a literature course here but I was kind of shocked. He's asking us to buy 5 different books that come out to around $70. Of course I can pirate it but he doesn't allow any electronics and stated that students must have the physical copy? i dont get why we cant just download the book and use it off our computer or ipads which most people have, and if not they can loan one from the school. Is this normal?? I've had to buy other school resources for chem, physics, and history classes which are inevitable but forcing us to buy the books when their are other means of getting them are kinda insane to me. I just don't get why we spend so much money for this school and then they drain us even more by having us buy extra resources for classes. So is this the norm for C LIT majors?? How do you have money for these courses!! These are my thoughts, I would love to hear from anyone who has taken a course like this. ",UCSantaBarbara

UCSC mom here. Need your help locating my daughter’s stolen e-bike (Actbest). It was stolen from Rachel Carson the night of October 15th. Allegedly there were several bikes stolen that night. 

She saw someone riding the same exact bike on Monday (Oct. 20) and today while she was waiting for the bus. (I’ve attached a picture and video.) I don’t want to wrongfully accuse anyone but just want to figure out if this is her bike or not as it’s the exact same one as hers. And, it isn’t that common of a brand.

She REALLY needs her bike back as she is having trouble walking uphills due to a recent ACL reconstruction surgery.  My bad for not putting a tracking device on it and her bad for not removing the battery that night; which she normally does every night. 

The e-bikes that are for rent there suck btw. She said each time since then that she’s tried to rent one, the battery wasn’t charged at all. 

Please help. (FYI report already filed with campus PD). ",UCSC

Update (10/22) 6AM: I’m escalating to speak to a supervisor to assert my rights and not let this go. 

Update: 622AM: Sargent did not acknowledge the sexual gratification component but now is asserting that it didn’t happened in a public place so doesn’t meet the criteria for criminal charges. 

Update: 633AM Watch Commander refused to acknowledge the criminal nature and declined to take a report. This shows that the sheriffs department would may not take the necessary steps to protect you in a similar situation. 

Update 11AM: the DA and Santa Cruz county sheriff have officially stated that they will not pursue said report or case meaning that if you fit my demographic and live with your landlord, indecent exposure in the home will not be pursued let alone investigated!

A person was rescued over the weekend after they were found 50 feet down an embankment near the UC Santa Cruz campus, Cecile Juliette, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, told SFGATE.

Rescue crews were called to a cliff rescue just before 11 a.m. on Sunday, Juliette said. The person was on Empire Grade, a scenic, windy road that leads into the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains and is a well-known spot for strenuous bike rides. Cal Fire did not disclose if the person was hiking or biking up the road. 

It’s also unknown if the rescue was called in by the person who fell or by a bystander. When crews from Cal Fire, the Santa Cruz Fire Department, Santa Cruz Police Department and California State Parks eventually found the person, they were injured, Juliette said.

Rescuers used a rope rescue system and hoisted the person out of the terrain with a stokes basket, Juliette said. (A stokes basket is a stretcher made of metal wire or plastic and designed to keep the rescuee stable.) A photo from the Cal Fire Facebook page shows the rescuers from various agencies carrying the basket through rugged terrain.

A CALSTAR helicopter, which is a medical air service, was able to land next to the rescue and help “cut out ground transportation time,” Cal Fire said in its social media post. The person was subsequently transported to a local hospital for their injury, Juliette added.

The region is a backbone ""for so many services that when things go screwy, domino effects around the internet-as-we-know-it are enormous,"" wrote John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity researcher at Citizen Lab, in a social media post.

AWS traced the source of the problem to something called the ""DynamoDB endpoint in the US-East-1 Region,"" in a pair of jargon-laden updates.

""DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know, but it underpins the apps and services that all of us use every single day,"" said cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple.

DynamoDB is a centralized database service that many internet-based services use to track user information, store key data and manage their operations, Chapple said by email.

It's ""one of the record-keepers of the modern internet,"" said Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. ""It's fast, it's cheap, and it's reliable. But today it stopped working and we saw the effects of that outage ripple across the internet.""

""Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data. It's as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia,"" Chapple said.

Amazon has attributed the outage to a domain name system issue. DNS is the service that translates internet addresses into machine-readable IP addresses that connects browsers and apps with websites and underlying web services. DNS errors disrupt the translation process, interrupting the connection.

Because so many sites and services use AWS, a DNS error can have widespread results.",UCSC

|The Water Department is partnering with Stanford University on a study to better understand how water costs are shared among renters in multi-family properties. The findings will help the city design future customer assistance programs that make water more affordable for renters in Santa Cruz. We’re looking for renters who live in apartments or multi-unit buildings within our service area to take part in a short, 15-minute tenant survey. Participants will receive $25 for their time. Every response helps us build a clearer picture of water affordability in our community.

Sophomore with trash GPA but actual research/projects - realistic shot at CUSC or nah,CodeWithInferno,1760625897,3,4,/r/UCSC/comments/1o882x7/sophomore_with_trash_gpa_but_actual/,,,"Alright I need some brutal honesty here because idk if I'm delusional or actually have a shot.

**The Bad News First:**

* Sophomore at Gannon University (tiny school in PA nobody's heard of)
* 2.94 GPA... yeah it's rough
* Got a D in Physics, C- in Calc 2 because I'm apparently allergic to traditional classes
* My CS grades are good though (A+, A+, A-, A-, B-) so it's really just the gen eds killing me

**But also here's what I've actually been doing:**

**Research (3 projects):**

1. Self-correction mechanisms in LLMs - worked on getting models to actually fix their own errors
2. Malicious APK detection using ML - Android malware classification
3. IoT anomaly detection - security stuff for IoT devices

**Projects:**

* Built Lokus - a full knowledge management app with OAuth 2.0, Gmail integration, cross-platform (Windows/Mac), 68 AI tools built into an MCP server. Like I literally implemented the entire auth system from scratch with PKCE and everything
* HackHarvard 2025 - competed against MIT/Stanford/CMU kids. Built IRIS, an iOS app using LiDAR + AI pathfinding for blind navigation with haptic feedback. Judges from big companies actually wanted to connect after
* Some app I made has 10k+ users (can't say which for privacy but it's live and people actually use it)

**Other stuff:**

* President of CS club, took 8 students to HackHarvard
* Actually know how to code - React, Rust, Swift, Python, Java, not just leetcode grinding
* Working on reinforcement learning stuff, implemented PPO algorithms

**The Reality Check:** If I get 3.7-3.8 next two semesters, I'll end up around 3.4 GPA by transfer apps. Still mid but better than 2.94.

**My actual question:** Do schools like UIUC or Berkeley even look at people like me? Like yeah my GPA is trash but I'm literally doing the research and building the systems they teach. I'm not just some kid with good grades who's never built anything real.

Or should I be realistic and focus on:

* Arizona State (they have insane AI programs, #1 in innovation)
* Purdue (new AI major, solid CS)
* Northeastern (co-op program, good for someone who learns by doing)
* UC San Diego (new AI undergrad major)

**I guess my real question is:** Do top CS programs care more about GPA or actual demonstrated ability? Because I can show them 3 research projects, multiple complex systems I've built from scratch, and competition experience... but that 2.94 is gonna be on the transcript forever.

Am I wasting my time applying to reaches or do I actually have a shot with this profile?

Also if anyone's transferred into a top CS program with a similar situation PLEASE let me know how tf you did it.

I can tag there with my current GPA, but I am staying two more years at CC to do major prep and improve my grades, as well as get more involved via starting a club and engaging more with my honors society, tutoring, etc. I’ve visited UCSC and I loved the campus. 

There are only two issues for me, housing and the fact that there is no formal Comparative Literature major. If anyone is a lit major, pls comment because that’s kinda the only thing that holds me back and makes me still hold out hope for Berkeley and UCLA, and consider UCI. (Davis is way too hot.)

How do you guys fare with the housing, and how many people end up homeless? (I am dead serious about this question.) I am low income to be fully transparent, but I expect to take out loans and also save my pell grant distributions these last two years at CC to put towards uni.

He's treating our INTRODUCTORY Physics class like an upper-div while also not teaching fundamental concepts. No Aris, not Vector Calc nor coding nor chemistry were prerequisites for this class. What are you on. Every single person I've talked to about the class hates it and doesn't understand (I am an A student!). He gives the most competent among us the yucky feeling that we're stupid when he hasn't taught us the things he expects us to know. Every lecture makes me even more of a Dhar apologist than I actually am to the point I feel relief and joy entering his 8am because of how rancid my tummy feels at 9:20 when Aris makes the entire class sit through 65 minutes of disjointed rambling that fails to teach the core methods necessary for the assigned work.

Is there some way to get the Physics department to audit our class? I hear he got banned from teaching Upper-Divs, and I honestly think he deserved it from how he's performed so far. Good grief. Obviously, I'll lock in and use the textbook to supplememt my learning, I'm not going to fail (despite taking 21 units), but dear lord I hope there's something we can do. I don't want to waste an entire quarter year on this class with Aris teaching it like he is.

If there's a way to have the Physics department make him get his shit together, or start using some pre-written curriculum, or replaced with someone else, or literally anything, that would be life-changing.

I went to the residency office today to talk to them about this but they were very explicit that they couldn’t give me advice for appealing. My mom is a resident in all ways and the one I’m actually dependent on. My dad doesn’t work and hasn’t in 8 years. Do you guys have any advice or help about this? ,UCSC

Don't talk to the RA. They are not your friend.,angeryping,1759135070,55,117,/r/UCSC/comments/1ntcqqb/dont_talk_to_the_ra_they_are_not_your_friend/,,,"I am speaking to this issue as a former RA. The student housing program requires RAs to chat with each resident, usually in-person chatting but can also be through email. The intent is to keep up with the residents and identify those who are in need of help or campus resources. You may hear about this under the names ""Intentional Interactions"" or ""One-on-one meetings"". These conversations can be logged in a google sheet that can be accessed by Student Housing staff. **Unfortunately, many RAs fail to disclose the fact that conversations with them are not private/confidential, let alone stored on the cloud.** Some students may want to befriend their RA and chat about sensitive information such as relationships, academics, or substance abuse. This information could very easily end up in the hands of housing supervisors or the conduct office. Even if you did nothing wrong, any misunderstanding from the housing staff (don't expect much from them) could lead to very real consequences involving your housing contract, student employment, or enrollment status. Obviously, the chance of this happening is 1%, but the impact said disaster is too great to ignore.

  
If you get messages from RAs claiming you are required to speak with them, you have the option to politely decline, per the 5th Amendment. 

  
Title is obviously dramatized (see on youtube ""Don't Talk to the Police""). I may sound a little crazy, but I speak from personal experience.  During my first year on campus, I only found out 6 months into living in the dorm that my RA had logged a good amount of our conversations and sent them to their CRE. Although there were no consequences, I felt violated by the lack of privacy and transparency in this process. 

When I left in 2024, it seemed like the Housing staff did not particularly care about this issue. Hopefully things are changing.",UCSC

I know the quarter only started but I've been going to the financial aid office in hopes of getting some help, wait un line for well over an hour. 

For a bit of background, based on the financial aid package I SHOULD get money back to me. Its quite literally the main reason I decided to go to UCSC in the first place.

I remember getting an email about the disbursement, and when I checked my account and accepted the awards, it said I still needed to pay about 400. 

When I went to the financial aid office for the time they said they were still disbursing the money given and that I should wait until next week.

Its next week and still nothing. Thankfully the advisor was nice and told me to come in if the money hadn't arrived. Had to wait in line for over an hour just to get halfway. 

All this to say, I wanted to ask, should I worry about the housing and dining fees too much? Does anyone else have this issue? What should I do? Im honestly so lost and frustrated rn bc I cant afford to have money that's supposed to be for things like textbooks and transportation be spent on something that was SUPPOSED to be covered by.

I was hoping to study at a UC around the SF Bay Area in CS/AI/DS, but it seems like the only real UC option near SF is UC Santa Cruz’s Silicon Valley campus (they offer the MS in NLP and HRI).

Does anyone here know:

* How strong are the job prospects and networking opportunities coming out of this campus?
* Is UCSC Silicon Valley considered a solid school in the Bay Area tech scene?
* For someone mainly looking to break into AI/DS/CS jobs in the Bay, is this a good move, or would I be better off targeting CSU options instead?

I know they say just take the units and multiply it by three but at the cc I just transferred from (also quarter system but its 12 weeks lol), that was not realistic at all because it seemed as though the professors made the courses easier (except physics).

Hello everyone,

I'm a CC student planning to transfer next fall, and I am going to major in psychology. While I'm open to all subfields, at the moment I think I'm leaning more towards cognitive and developmental. I am hoping to hear from students themselves who are currently studying psych or have in the past at UCSC, as I weigh all my options on which UC to transfer to.

Please feel free to share anything! All input is appreciated.

Some pointers:

* Thoughts on pacing/assignment load, work/life balance? (I haven't done quarter system)
* What challenges should a transfer student expect in the psych program?
* Are there opportunities for research or internships as an undergrad?
* How approachable are the faculty and advisors?
* Any tips for succeeding or standing out in the program?
* Rec. courses, maybe particularly useful for cognitive or developmental psych?
* What resources (clubs, tutoring, workshops) help students succeed in psychology?
* Overall experience at UCSC (pros/cons)",UCSC

You will undock it and then head to class to only find out that all the docks are filled and you have to find 3 other stations to find one with a spot then walk a decent distance back to your actually class. 

Best case you check the app to see if it's full or empty then go and pray that nobody docks while you are on the way and you can get there under 30 minutes and not get charged overage fees. Maybe worth the stress or maybe not. 

The worst case is you get there and it's all full and you have to go to 3 different stations to find one with space, you go over your allocated time budget and get charged overage fees and then end up walking to class which would have been faster if you took the bus or walked directly depending on the trip.

This post is a warning to everyone to stay away from Klesis Christian Fellowship. They are from Acts2 which used to be called Gracepoint, which used to be called Berkland. It's a high control group and once you get sucked in, they will end up controlling most of your life.

They will lure you with free food and instant friends. They have a ""Frosh Social and Night Market"" today. Please don't go. Or if you do go, don't give them your phone number or email address. Don't tell them where you live.

Be warned and do not join this group. For the first year, they will make it seem like it's all just fun and they just want to get to know you. They use love bombing to lure you to their group and then as the years pass, they will want you to spend most of your time, if not all, with this group and this group only.

Christianity Today published [an article](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/09/gracepoint-berkland-asian-american-church-discipleship/) about this group and as a former member, I can confidently say that everything they wrote is true.

As long as you’re getting on a bus that goes to campus (not the 17 or the capitola routes) the drivers don’t gaf, they will assume you’re students. Look them in the eye, say thank you as you get on, and you’re set. I’ve heard of the occasional asshole driver that makes you show an id, but they’re not common. 

For the other bus routes, you need your id. These drivers aren’t used to seeing students all the time as their primary riders.

Overall, the drivers are all chill, it’s not that deep. Don’t hold up the line to dig for your id, don’t bother showing the GET app. I hope this helps.",UCSC

The Buses??? (help please),itsxbailey,1758414034,3,3,/r/UCSC/comments/1nmdwit/the_buses_help_please/,,,"okay this might be long so i apologize in advance. i’m a new transfer student and i’ve never taken public transport by myself before and i don’t wanna get lost. 

so im living in the village &amp; one of my classes is in Steven Academy which, according to google maps, is abt a 20 minute walk. another on is in Thinmann Lecture Hall and is abt a 30 minute walk. i feel like those will be fine. 

BUT

my issue is that my two night classes. they are in the Kresge Academic Building which is roughly a 50ish minute walk. my first class starts at 5pm and my second classes ends at 8:45pm. i feel like i can manage walking to class but realistically i dont wanna walk around for almost an hour at night. 

i’m trying to understand the buses here but im getting confused. are there even buses that run that late??? i’m assuming it’s the night upper campus bus but i’ve seen different times for hour late they run and the TAPS website doesn’t say. &amp; if i don’t feel like walking im assuming i’d take the upper campus limited bus (which honestly i think that’s the only one i understand). 

ALSO 

i would like to understand the loop bus system, because i tbh i don’t wanna always walk everywhere, but the maps link don’t work??? like on the TAPS website the link to the two maps just sends me back to the homepage.

"Don't get lost like I did! How UCSC Buses work, for freshman",Alternative_Key_6030,1758403154,21,126,/r/UCSC/comments/1nm9w88/dont_get_lost_like_i_did_how_ucsc_buses_work_for/,,,"Literally my first day on campus I wanted to go from Kresge to the gym. I hopped on the 18 bus, thinking it would just loop around back to campus. Nope! It went to downtown and stopped there, leaving me stuck. Thought a guide would be helpful

### PRE-NOTE: I have the ""ucsc bus theorem"". It's pretty simple.

If the distance is less than 2 stops, if a bus isn't visible when you get to a bus stop JUST WALK 🙏. 95% of the time you will get there faster than the bus. For example JRL -&gt; Kresge, or Quarry -&gt; Crown.

## LOOP BUS

Loop buses are box-shaped and **NEVER** articulated buses (the slinky ones). They say ""loop"" clearly on the top display sign.

Loop buses **do not run during the day on weekends!** Plan for this.  
\- Regular service is available 7:30am -&gt; 5:30pm.

Sometimes buses will say ""upper campus"". This means they basically just go back and forth from Oakes -&gt; main entrance.

If you are at Porter/RC and see a upper campus loop bus, it will take a **LONG TIME** to reach the campus entrance because instead of driving down empire grade, it will loop back through campus!

## City Bus: 18, 19, 11, 20

First of all, I don't recommend taking the bus to get around downtown Santa Cruz. It's a surprisingly bikeable city. Get the ebike membership (bcycle), ucsc subsidizes it. Anywhere left of the river is less than a 10-minute ride away.

The 19 buses travel **clockwise** around campus. 18 travels **counterclockwise**.

IMPORTANT: City buses do not necessarily LOOP back around to campus! They have a very long route that goes into the city, usually ends at Trader Joes.

So, if you are at Kresge and want to go to the gym, do not rely on the 18 to loop around and get you there!

Here is the full bus schedule: https://scmtd.com/en/routes/202610/11/wd

## General Transportation Tips

Unspoken rule, but if your destination is one stop away, just walk! Our campus has a very accessible ""school area"". Most lecture halls and locations are walkable and definitely bike able from each other.

The walking trails and beautiful routes between classes is one of the things I have enjoyed most about ucsc. It gives you a moment to cool off and think. So try and enjoy that instead of endlessly complaining about the bus schedule...

Tomorrow I am going to try to obtain a PLUS loan, but the odds are not good as my credit got wrecked a couple of years ago when I lost my job.

PSA: Some Hwy 17 Express busses ONLY go to Scotts Valley now,cabalex,1758152513,2,91,/r/UCSC/comments/1njt06d/psa_some_hwy_17_express_busses_only_go_to_scotts/,,,"Per [SC Metro's new schedule](https://scmtd.com/en/metro-news-bulletins), Hwy 17 Express busses departing from San Jose Diridon Station at **6:40 AM, 7:30 AM, 1:20 PM, and 3:20 PM** will ONLY go to Scotts Valley and WILL NOT go to Santa Cruz. The bus will say ""Hwy 17 Express to Scotts Valley via Scotts Valley Dr"".

Note that this only occurs on weekdays. All 17 busses go to Santa Cruz on weekends.

To connect to Santa Cruz on these buses, you will need to transfer to the 35X. (If you do not have a student ID, ask the 17 bus driver for a transfer to Santa Cruz.) While this is supposed to be a ""timed"" transfer, the bus is usually late, so you'll probably have to wait about 10 minutes. **On average, this will add an additional 25 minutes to your trip.**

This makes all but the 1:20 PM bus irrelevant, as you might as well just hop on the next 17 to Santa Cruz and get there at about the same time.

This is part of an effort to give more seats to Scotts Valley riders, and they need to get the buses to SV somehow. I guess we'll see how it plays out...",UCSC

I have a roommate who applied at Gen Korean BBQ, and their management practices explain exactly why the place struggles. They hire managers who seem completely untrained in actual management. Employees are told not to clock in even when arriving on time for their scheduled shift, simply because there are no customers yet. Shifts get canceled constantly with no regard for workers’ time or income. It sounds like an awful place to work.

Hopefully this reaches their corporate office. Invest in better management and respect your employees. Customers already have plenty of complaints about this location. UTC is not a rundown area, so stop running the restaurant like it is.

Im a freshman at ucsd and since deciding to attend I feel like the school has done nothing but make me feel like they didn’t want me to actually accept. I have severe social anxiety to the point where I spent a large portion of my childhood unable to leave the house on my own. Despite this being very well documented, the Osd randomly ghosted me despite multiple calls and emails leaving me completely on my own in a triple dorm. Additionally, I have been on an anti-anxiety medication for years and almost had to go through withdrawals because the campus pharmacy would not respond to my requests to send my medication there. I live in a near constant state of anxiety because of how little privacy I have(resulting in me waking up constantly throughout the night) and have been showering multiple times a day just so my roommates wont hear me cry. On top of that I have a lot of uncommon food allergies and have had several scares with dining hall food to the point where Im forced to cook everything myself. Every place I reach out to sends me to someone else, and it feels like they don’t actually want to help and just want to get rid of me. I know I struggle to make friends and I was prepared for some level of isolation, but I haven’t had a word spoken to me in weeks and I somehow feel as though Im both too surrounded by people and too isolated? The whole reason I picked this school was for the quality of classes, but I am finding all the material to be shallower and easier than the stuff I learned in high school. In short im miserable and feel like Im not even getting the education I wanted to show for it. Does it get easier? Will my classes become more rigorous? I would love to hear from students with a few more years under their belt because Im finding it hard to make myself stay here.

There are 2 tasks. The 1st task is about 30 min. The 2nd task is about 40 min. Max 1.5h combined.

(1)If you'd like to do the 1st part for $20, book a 30 min slot; (2)If you'd like to do the full task for $40 in one seating, then book 3 consecutive slots; (3)If you'd like to do the full task for $40 at two different time, book them separately, task1 uses a 30min slot, task2 uses two consecutive 30min slots.

And if u have joined my studies before, you are eligible for only part2 (because you have already done part1)😅

If this is you, go find 5 PIs who work in the realm you're considering and ask them what they would have an extra pair of grad student hands/eyes work on, if they magically had an extra F grant to pay them. *Everyone* has a list of projects or open questions they'd like to tackle if they had the bodies to throw at it, and generally they'll know the kind of skillset they would look for in the person who could succeed at it. You can roll the dice with abstract insight as people talk about ""where the field is going"" but:

A) expect all your peers to have heard the same thing so it is not beneficial to you as one person in a competitive group,

B) people don't really get hired by the field, they get hired by PIs and lab managers, and

C) the NIH is being dismantled by Nazis, meaning the competition is going to radically ramp up.

I've taken Calc 1, 2, 3, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and am currently doing statistics/probability theory. I have yet to take stochastic processes, but what I'm concerned about is that the UCSD bioinformatics PhD program (even the BMI track that I'm interested in) seems to be very CS-heavy and requires background in data structures and algorithms, which I don't have. However, I watched the 2023 admissions video and some of the students said that basic familiarity with CS is adequate, so if anyone has more insight, I'd appreciate it. 

As of now, I'm not sure what I want to do for my career because at this point I'm open to anything, but I'm particularly interested in genetic epidemiology, analyzing a wide range of patient genetic and epidemiological data to improve medical treatments.

a) how much parental leave did you get as an ASE or GSR if you took leave since 2022?

b) how do you interpret the wording in the contract?

**D. LONG-TERM LEAVE**

1. Leave Eligibility  
Salaried ASEs who take a leave pursuant to Section D.2 shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of paid leave per academic year.

2. Upon request from an ASE and subject to the provisions of this Article, the University will grant an ASE’s reasonable request for long-term leave due to:

Just wanted to share something I saw this morning around 7:30 AM near the US Bank ATM in La Jolla Village.

There was a guy dressed in all black, wearing a Scream mask, carrying a backpack, skateboard, and what looked like steel cables. He walked into the Urban Plates patio, which is closed until 11 AM. The whole thing felt really off — especially at that hour.

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him around. The last time was around 10:30 PM near Ralphs in the same area. He was wearing the same outfit and mask, with both hands in his pockets, walking between cars and hiding behind them like he was trying not to be seen. It really creeped me out.

I just want to remind everyone — especially students and people walking alone — to stay aware of your surroundings. We’ve all heard about the recent incident with a man in a lion mask at La Jolla Shores attacking someone, so please be careful out there.

Stay safe, everyone.

Extremely secretive person to the point of being psychotic. Begs his mom to let him double major in Physics. Then last year, he says he's done with undergrad and is taking PhD courses online. I have no idea when he actually last set foot on campus physically. One of those stay in his room 24/7 in a bathrobe people. He hasn't taken a campus class physically since before Covid hit. His mother was so happy he got accepted. Well...not so fast, see below. 

So yesterday I go on a mountain bike group ride, one of the riders is a PhD math student. I say my stepson is also in the program and taking online classes. He says there are no online graduate classes in math. He then looks up the student's name on the graduate directory...it's missing. I text my wife that we need to talk about this. She confronts him and he does admit that 'technically' he's not in the PhD program yet. 

Here is his plan and please tell me how whacked out this is, or if it could actually work: UCSD allows 5.5 years or 200 credits before forcing graduation (or kicking them out). If he double majored, I assume that's 11.0 years and 400 credits? He's been there since 2017 so he has until 2028 to finalize everything? He'll be 33 years old in 2 months BTW... Graduate school is $20K a year. His plan is to take as many PhD courses as he can (if he is indeed really taking ANY of them online) as an undergrad who as a scholarship and doesn't pay for classes. If he can take two years of classes and get those out of the way, and pass the qualifying exam, then in theory he only has two years left for a dissertation and he saves $40K for not having to pay for four years. 

IMO it's a really f-ed up way to go about trying to save $40K. If it works, and he gets his PhD and actually moves out and gets a postdoc somewhere, all will be more or less forgiven. I personally think it will not work; first of all he never even applied for the program and there is no guarantee he will be accepted. He does have other offers in Texas and Florida as a backup (out of state tuition of course). 

Can he really take most/all of his PhD classes still enrolled as an undergrad? And are any graduate classes online, especially in math?",ucsd

1 year later, I obtain the needed skills for the job through completing my masters program and completing my research project

I apply for the same role and my application doesn't even make it to the interview stage.  Apparently they are looking for more junior level applicants.

Want to join a pre-health/pre-nursing organization on campus that is not overpopulated compared to others?? Join PRENSA...PRENSA stands for ""Pre-Nursing Student Association"". We guide and shed light on a community of pre-nursing students here at UCSD. You don't necessarily have to be pre-nursing; we invite anyone with pre-health interests. We host GBMs, socials, volunteer, internships, and more opportunities. Our main goal for this year is giving back to the UCSD and San Diego community by doing more hands-on work. Whether that is making care packages for the homeless, care packages for UCSD students, or taking trips to Tijuana to volunteer at clinics there as well. This may be a great opportunity for you if you're looking for a pre-health organization that is not as populated as others, making it more likely for you to gain experience. Most of our board members have certifications such as CNA, MA, and Med Tech...we guide out members on the path of getting certifications that you can have before expanding your education post bachelors. Get hands-on clinical experience by letting us mentor you on where to get your certification, what places to apply, and more. Through collaboration, mentorship, and advocacy efforts, members will enhance their understanding of the healthcare field, promote a commitment towards compassionate care, and support each other’s journey towards becoming empathetic healthcare professionals with obtained knowledge, insight, and information surrounding the field of nursing.

  
At our first GBM you will find out about a volunteer opportunity for this Sunday 10/26 &amp; an upcoming social event! 

FIRST GBM TUESDAY 10/21 TOMORROW @ CENTER HALL 

ROOM NUMBER WILL BE DISCLOSED 45MIN BEFORE GBM STARTS @ 6:30PM ON OUR INSTAGRAM!!

Hey everyone! I’m a psychology major at UCSD, and this is my last year here. I’ve been a bit shy and haven’t really put myself out there as much as I should have. I’m not looking to be best friends with anyone, but I’d love to make some cool friends before I graduate. I’d love to hang out with people I can actually be friends with outside of UCSD. I’m a female, so I’d love female friends! Males are okay too, as long as you’re really cool and not weird. I’m a transfer student, which is part of the reason why it’s been so hard for me to put myself out there. I don’t really commute often, but I’ve been feeling a little lonely. I’m a big fan of trying new things and exploring new places. I’m thinking of going on some hikes around here, and I’ve always been interested in trying “extreme” activities that would probably make most people SH**T themselves. Basically, I don’t want to be friends with anyone who’s too scared to live their life. I get scared too, but I want to meet friends who will challenge us to step outside our comfort zones. Of course, there will be boundaries at first, but I really want to meet friends who are as adventurous as I am (YOLO). Another thing I’ve been wanting to do is go to HHN. I’ve been there before, but it wasn’t as much fun because no one made me feel comfortable enough to be there with them. I really want to have a friend who we can laugh together all night long. I’m a bit weird, but in a really good way… I’m not looking specifically for a psychology major friend, but it would be preferred just because I struggle sometimes in school, and having a friend in that major would make me feel more sane. 

Something I’d like to mention though is… I’m the type of person who sometimes needs a little space, so there might be times when I don’t respond right away or even go a couple days without texting. Please don’t take it personally! It has nothing to do with me not liking you or not wanting to be friends, I just get really focused or overwhelmed with school/life and accidentally go quiet. That being said, I’m still serious about making real friendships. We don’t have to talk every single day to be close, but if we do end up clicking and talking all the time, I’m totally down for that too. I just wanted to put it out there so no one feels ignored or unappreciated. I value quality over constant texting, and I love friendships where we can pick up right where we left off, and still go on fun/adventurous plans together.",ucsd
